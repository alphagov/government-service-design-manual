# Design patterns

We'll be maintaining a library here of common web interface elements and assorted CSS helpers, so you can quickly build interfaces in the GOV.UK style.

We'll add to the library as more digital services are built. If there's something you need that's not here let us know - we might be able to repurpose something from another product that's in development.

If you find yourself creating new interface elements that you're particularly pleased with also let us know and we'll look at adding them to the library.

Most patterns consist of snippets of HTML, CSS and sometimes JavaScript, together with guidance on how best to use them.

The patterns make heavy use of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), so you'll need to find a way of using it in your project if you're to get the most out of the library. You'll find the [Sass files](https://github.com/alphagov/prototyping/tree/master/_includes/stylesheets/design-patterns) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/alphagov/prototyping/tree/master/_includes/javascripts/design-patterns) for each pattern in our [Prototyping app](https://github.com/alphagov/prototyping/), so you can use them directly in your prototypes or copy them into your project.
