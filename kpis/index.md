The [digital by default standard](digital-by-default.html) sets four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of your service: cost per transaction, customer satisfaction, transaction success and digital take-up.

For each KPI you will work with GDS to set a sensible goal and interim milestones on the way towards meeting them. 

Once live, service performance will be monitored and displayed on the [performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance).
