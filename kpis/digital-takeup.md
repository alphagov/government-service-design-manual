#Drawing up a channel shift strategy
We want those who are able to use our digital services to do so. For those who can and do use digital services already, we need to improve the quality of the services to make them clearly preferable to the alternatives.

We also need to make people aware of the services that are available. A number of techniques can be used to raise awareness and encourage people to use digital channels. Departments will consider which methods are most appropriate to the context of their service, and the needs of their service users.

##Guidance
To encourage people to use digital channels, you need to develop (service by service) an understanding of their needs, what is currently holding them back from digital use (and therefore what appeals you need to make to change their behaviour), and which channels or intermediaries they will trust to give them the right information or reassurance to use digital.  You can then tailor your promotional efforts accordingly.

Things to do...

###Promotion
- tailor your messages based on user priorities/benefits, using insight data/segmentation (test out different ‘appeals’) - and keep your marketing plans refreshed as you progress through different segments
- defining and publicising the benefits to users (better for you/cheaper for taxpayers/green, etc) segment by segment, and ‘myth-busting’ the barriers
- including memorable urls prominently on all publicity, both hard and soft copy (preferably with deep links tailored to the specific service, not just to a home page).  This should include all branding opportunities -  email footers, out of hours phone messages, and all correspondence.  The urls should take precedence over traditional contact methods like phone numbers
- creating/looking for sign-up opportunities (if applicable) to create a relationship with users; his way you can keep users updated as you improve - and also consider deploying ‘pass it on’ messages to successful users, to encourage word of mouth spread to their acquaintances
- piggy back on other campaigns/initiatives to achieve trial - and get good links onto sites people use for other things (e.g. community sites - via your advocacy/partnership - see below)
- Use newer channels like social media to signpost people to your service

###Advocacy
- use user journey mapping to identify any current/potential points of contact - then train frontline staff actively to offer digital service - contact centres, floorwalkers, staff out in the field (demonstrating, forwarding links, floor-walking to divert from queues, assisting with digital transactions rather than taking over, etc) . To do this you need to get good staff buy-in and ‘sell’ benefits to them
- get opinion formers involved in initiatives from the start - recruit partners who can get involved, e.g. community groups, Family Information Services, schools (headteachers and governing bodies), children’s centres, libraries, customer service centres, etc
- don’t neglect your offline channels - potential users will probably get reassurance by talking to or dealing with contacts they trust, and in many cases this will mean through face to face conversations

###Incentivising
- incentivising (where possible) is a useful strategy - this could mean offering lower charges where transactions are undertaken digitally (where the service runs on a cost recovery model, and you can pass on a proportion of resulting savings) or a faster turnround on the transaction. Other incentives used have included prize draws, early information on service changes or opportunities where users have signed up electronically, etc.
- look for ‘extras’ that you can offer through your digital service to add value  to potential users - for example, easy progress tracking for digital transactors, review facilities, SMS reminders, etc
- use registration to both learn more about users but also to offer enhanced relationships, e.g. personalised updates (not just on your website but via social media sites etc - whatever people are likely to use)

###Reassuring/reinforcing
- understand perceived barriers;  and focus on removing them or myth-busting them
- put reassurance steps into your process design (for example, acknowledgement of a successfully completed application, a reference number for tracking)
- provide helplines/webchat to support digital (rather than to shift people back to the more traditional channels)

###Clarifying
- be clear on what information a user needs to complete a transaction, and flag this up for them as early as possible. If they have everything to hand before they start this should help prevent process drop-outs.

###Continuing
- once someone transacts digitally assume this is their preferred route in the future - don’t revert to paper for future contacts

###Collaboration
- explore how working together with partners (government or commercial) might help you connect with your target audiences better

and things to avoid...

###Perverse incentives

- providing unstructured routes into your service (such as email addresses) - instead use e-forms feeding straight into your back office systems
- making your less efficient channels too easy (for example by pre-populating hard copy forms - especially if you don’t do this online!)
- overloading your online transaction channels with information requests (instead define what information you need to deliver this service accurately and securely - and don’t ask for more)
- unquestioningly maintaining or enhancing service standards for less favoured channels
- setting up outsourcing contracts where the company has no incentive to encourage or support people to undertake transactions online (for example if they are paid per call handled)


##Why we do this
The [Government Digital Strategy] (http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#persuading-those-who-are-online-to-use-government-digital-services) requires departmental digital strategies to include plans to encourage channel shift to digital services. These will be reviewed annually.

##Further reading
The [Sheffield Channel Shift project](http://www.pscsf.org.uk/2012/08/channel-shift-helping-people-use-public-services-online/) showed the impact of concerted partnership working in promoting digital take-up.

Some [Cabinet Office Case studies](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/261356/channel_strategy_cases.pdf) from 2009 show how government services run by Companies House, DVLA and HMRC used user insight to promote increased digital take-up.

There are numerous [public sector case studies] (http://www.psfbuzz.org.uk/2011/09/pscsf-compendium-of-channel-shift-self-service-resources/#.UMc-smNNs0N) that explore channel shift.
