The [Digital by Default standard](/digital-by-default) sets four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of your service: cost per transaction, user satisfaction, completion rate and digital take-up.

For each KPI you will work with GDS to set a sensible goal and interim milestones on the way towards meeting them.

Once live, service performance will be monitored and displayed on the [Performance Platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance).
