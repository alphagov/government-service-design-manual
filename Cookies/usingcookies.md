#Using Cookies
This short guide tells you what to keep in mind when including cookies into your services.

##Guidance
Minimise the use of cookies throughout services, and store as little information as you require to deliver a good service to users.

If your service requires new cookies to be set then you need to ensure that they can be explained simply and clearly, in a way that the majority of users can understand.

You will need to notify users whenever a specific action sets a cookie. This will look like this: 

>[sets a cookie](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies#). 

That link will take users to the cookies page, and the appropriate description of the cookie being set.

##Code/Templates
On [the cookies page at GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies) you can see a breakdown of the kinds of cookie used throughout the site, followed by an explanation of each cookie’s purpose. For example;

>###Storing your approximate location
>Some pages on this site provide you with information based on your location. So when you enter your postcode, we save your approximate location to a cookie. This means you don’t have to keep typing your postcode in, and means we’ll always point you towards services that are closest to you e.g. the nearest UK online centre.

##Why we do this
This cookies policy was devised following extensive research during the beta of GOV.UK. It followed the [The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1208/contents/made) (PECR). You can read more about how we decided this in [this blog post by GDS Developer Dafydd Vaughan](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/12/cookies-on-the-beta/).
