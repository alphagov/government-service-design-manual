#How to use the Manual

This short guide to the [Government Service Design Manual](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/) describes how you can use it for your projects, and what kind of feedback we’ll need to take into our Beta.

Remember, this site is an ‘alpha’ prototype. The guidance is incomplete, and shouldn’t yet be considered the canonical versions.

The [Digital by Default standard](/digital-by-default) is a list of criteria that services and teams must meet before they go live. This list is very much under discussion, but it gives you a sense of what’s currently under consideration.

Creating a standard for services to meet was [one of the actions in the Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard), and that includes things like basing development around users needs, iterating a service based on feedback, and making plans to meet key performance indicators.

##The guidance

The [guides and toolkits](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/) are a pool of knowledge about how to build digital by default services. It contains code and copy for people to reuse, as well as advice about how to build features and the reasons for it.

When it’s released, teams across government will be able to contribute new approaches and tools. For now it’s been populated by GDS staff. 

Not every heading is full of content - around half of the guidance has been returned at time of writing - but if you want to see good examples of guidance then take a look at the pages about [Colour palettes](/guides-and-toolkits/colours).

##Sending feedback

We would love to get feedback on your experiences of using the Government Service Manual.

Please send us your thoughts: [dbd-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:dbd-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

We will use your feedback to help build the beta version of this tool. 

Some guiding questions...

**The Standard**

* Is 'the Standard' page enough to tell you about Digital by Default?
* What would you like to see in this area?
* We are considering providing a lens view so that information relevant to the role of person logged in is most prominently displayed. Would this be useful to you?
* This section could link through to relevant pieces of guidance. Is this something you would like to see? Or is there anything else you would require here?

**Guidance**

* Is the guidance easy to navigate?
* Would you like to see the guidance structured in any other way?
* Is there any other guidance you want to see in the guidance?
* Would you like access to additional help from these pages?
