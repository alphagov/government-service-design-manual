#Discussion Guides

Discussion guides are used in order to ensure that focus groups and 1:1 interviews cover the required topics, and information is obtained from the sessions that will address the needs of the research. 

##Where/how you might use it

In preparation for a focus group/1:1 interviews it is helpful to generate a list of questions that address the information that you're interested in obtaining from the sessions. These questions should be open ended, and structured in a manner that will form the basis for a draft discussion guide, and help illicit information from respondents in a sensible flow. Writing a discussion guide should be an iterative process and once the initial draft has been written it is helpful to get input from other people on the project team. 

As suggestion in the name, discussion guides should be used as a guide to the discussion, and in comparison with a structured questionnaire, questions and areas for coverage should not read out verbatim. This enables the discussion to be led by respondents’ own experience.

Typically each section of the guide would include time guidance to ensure all areas can be covered and it should also indicate when stimulus is being used, and specifics participants’ tasks.
