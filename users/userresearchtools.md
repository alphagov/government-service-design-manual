**Remote user testing tools** - These tools enable user research teams to conduct remote usability testing in-house. These tools allow you to script the surveys easily, while also conduct the analysis to be conducted relatively simply and quickly. Most of these tools also enable you to conduct standard online survey within the same software package. Available tools are below:

##Where/how you might use it##

Online tools are a good way in which to conduct in-house research cheaply and effectively. Conducting research in-house enables user research teams get closer to the data, and have a good understanding of the user. This is, however, dependent on teams having adequate resource to enable analysis to be conducted properly and fed back to the relevant teams.

##Weaknesses/when not to use##

Using online research tools in-house can be cheaper that assigning a third party agency to conduct the work, however, as pointed out above, this is dependent of user research teams having adequate resource.

##No./Types of participants##

Participants can be obtained internally through websites, emails, and other user channels, or via third party sample companies.

##Cost##

Some tools are free, but licences for others can range from £15k to 20k.

##Timescales##

Research can be conducted quickly as little set up time is required.
