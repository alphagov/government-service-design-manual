This guidance talks about how lab based user testing can be used to provide user research that can feed into product and service design.

##Guidance

User testing is a ‘qualitative’ research method that is used to gauge how easy and intuitive a (product, service, website) is to use and whether it supports the needs of it’s intended audience.

From a traditional perspective, user testing measures how well participants respond in the key areas of: efficiency, accuracy, recall and emotional response but nowadays this approach is combined with more ‘qualitative’ techniques to help understand the users’ motivations and attitudes as well. 

A product or service is usually assessed by asking small samples of the ‘target audience, in one to one sessions, to complete specific but realistic tasks. The facilitator observes how well the participants are able to complete those tasks, noting down the areas or features that cause the participant problems. Often the facilitator will ask participants to think aloud whilst completing those tasks in order to understand their decision processes better.

User testing can be conducted on low-fi assets e.g. paper prototypes, wireframes and hi-fi assets e.g. html/css prototypes, live digital services. It’s most effective when conducted early within the lifecycle of a product but can be conducted towards the end of the service lifecycle to validate any usability improvements.

##Where/how you might use it

A lab environment can provide a more formal setting for conducting sessions, with most spaces offering viewing facilities enabling stakeholders and key team members to watch the sessions in real time. 

##Weaknesses/when not to use

Usability testing is best suited to finding the big issues, essentially the problems that affect users trying to perform tasks. However, it is qualitative in nature and is not statistically robust due to the small participant numbers, per round.

The lab environment may also be considered a weakness. It means testing is conducted in a very different space to that a user will commonly be in.

This method is not an appropriate for understanding user behaviour or user needs e.g. what they might want from a product / service. 

##No./Types of participants

Between 5-8 participants, per round of user testing is sufficient to highlight the majority of usability issues. The key is to test often.

##Cost

Costs will vary according to your target audience e.g. niche expertise, hard to reach etc.
The easiest way to recruit participants is to use a market research recruitment agency. Expect to pay from £150-£200 per recruit (includes finders fee and cash incentive).

Lab hire per day varies depending on location and facilities. Expect to pay between £800-£1200 per day.

##Timescales

Dependent on project scope, availability of testing assets and resource.
Recruitment via an agency will take up to 2 weeks
Conducting testing sessions can take between 2-3 days depending on how many participants have been scheduled. Analysis and reporting can take up to a week.
