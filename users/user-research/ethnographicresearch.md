#Ethnographic research
This guidance looks at Ethnographic research and how it can be used in order to provide user research to feed into product and service design. 

##Guidance
 
Ethnographic research usually involves observing target users in their natural, real-world setting,  rather than in the artificial environment of a lab or focus group.  The aim is to gather insight into how people live; what they do; how they use things; or what they need in their everyday or professional lives.  Observations can be made at home, at work, or in leisure environments - people can be studied with their family, on their own, with work colleagues, or as part of a group of friends.  Often one participant may be recruited, but several more may be studied as part of that person’s family or friends.  

Ethnographic research relies on techniques such as observation, video diaries, photographs, contextual interviews, and analysis of artifacts such as for example devices, tools or paper forms that might be used as part of a person’s job.  

Data collection can range from a 4-5 hour contextual interview, through to following a participant for several days, or even a longitudinal study over several weeks or months to investigate, for example, how a particular product or service might be used over time.  It doesn’t necessarily involve “full immersion” in a person’s life: it can involve a depth interview in a person’s home or it might involve a person simply maintaining their own video diary over a period of time.
 
##Where/how you might use it
 
Ethnographic research can provide extremely rich insight into “real life” behaviour, and can be used to identify new or currently unmet user needs. This approach is most valuable at the beginning of a project when there is a need to understand real end user needs, or to understand the constraints of using a new product or service by a particular audience.
 
##Weaknesses/when not to use
 
Ethnographic research can provide a significant amount of qualitative data, and analysis can be time consuming.  

The term ‘ethnographic’ can be misused, it’s currently a bit of a “buzz word” with some agencies who may not fully understand the approach.  It is recommended that a specialist agency is used, who can demonstrate successful case studies (collecting and analysing the data). 
 
##Participants
 
In principle, anyone could participate in this type of research.  As with any user research, the recruitment of suitable participants is key.  The full implications of the research should be fully explained to potential participants, as some may not feel comfortable with this level of intrusion in their lives.
 
##Timescales
 
Depending on the study needs and the approach, but 6-8 weeks from briefing to results can provide rich insight.  It may take time to build trust with participants, and the analysis period needs to be sufficient to be thorough.
 
##Cost
 
Ethnographic research can be expensive and time consuming, but this depends on the needs of a particular project.  The benefits derived can be extremely valuable.

##GDS example
 
Ethnographic techniques were used in the recent Digital Landscape research in order to understand why some people choose not to conduct government transactions online
