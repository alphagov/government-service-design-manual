#Online Omnibus surveying

This guidance looks at online Omnibus surveys and how they can be used in user research.

##Guidance

Online Omnibus surveys are an effective way of interviewing a representative number of people, in a short period of time, and for a relatively low cost. Omnibus surveys of this type use an online panel to gather the sample, and as with regular offline Omnibus survey, costs are kept down by collating questions on a variety of subjects, from a number of clients. 

##Where/how you might use it

Omnibus panels are ideal when you have key questions that you want answering, and need to reach a representative number of people quickly and cheaply.

##Weaknesses/when not to use

A Omnibus survey is not appropriate when there are too many questions required. This would result in the survey being too long (combined with questions from other clients).

##No./Types of participants

Online panels are ideal for obtaining a representative sample of respondents (2000+), across all demographics, including hard to reach groups.

##Cost

Omnibus surveys are costed by the type of questions clients want to ask. Pre-coded questions are the cheapest (approximately £300 per question), and open ended or questions with video clips the most expensive (approximately £600 per question).

A set of ten questions on an Online Omnibus would cost approximately £5,000, depending on question type.

##Timescales

An online Omnibus panel can be conducted relatively quickly, with most companies running surveys twice a week with data delivered 4 days after survey goes in to field. Some companies offer an ‘on demand’ service where surveys can start any time, although a minimum of questions is normally required.
