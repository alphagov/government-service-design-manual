#Survey sampling methodologies

When conducting quantitative research it is essential that all findings are statistically valid so that there is confidence in the findings and inferences can be made from the sample to the population. This process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as ‘sampling’ and enables researchers to understand the views, and needs of a user base, without interviewing the whole user population.

##Guidance

Consideration needs to be given to how the sample is collected (who, how, where, when) and the size of the sample collected for each study. A large sample size can be more accurate and provide greater confidence in the data collected, however a large sample is not required for all research projects. The sample method chosen should consider the size and scale of the project, the sub-group analysis required, and balance the robustness of the approach that with the time, money, and resource available to ensure its fit for purpose.

Sampling can be a complex process to understand, but on most occasions a sample of 400-500 will be sufficient for most in-house studies - again this is dependent on the level of subgroup analysis needed and also the penetration of the target group in the population. The greater the number of population groups that need to be analysed may increase the sample size needed, as typically for findings to be statistically valid a minimum of 100 in a subgroup is required. A larger overall sample of 1000+ is normally required if findings need to be nationally representative. 

##Further reading

The following guide to sampling was written by the National Audit Office, and although it was first published in 2001, still provides a helpful introduction to sampling methodologies.
