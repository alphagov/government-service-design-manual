This guidance talks about how same day user testing can be used to provide user research that can feed into product and service design.

##Guidance

Like standard remote usability testing, same day user testing also takes place outside the lab with users participating in their own home, using their own computers, and with no third party moderator present.
 
Where standard remote usability testing focuses on large numbers, and providing statistically significant findings, this type of testing enables you to get rich, qualitative data from respondents that would normally only be possible by observing users in person.
 
As there is no moderator present, each session is recorded via screen capture software, that records the whole session, including the user talking about what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they feel about it etc.
 
All interviews are conducted in one hour, with the video sessions, and the answers to the follow up questions made available immediately.  Analysis is then conducted in house.
 
##Where/how you might use it

Rapid 1:1 testing can be used to test both website content, and online services. Each session involves participants completing a series of online tasks to see how they use the website or tool to find information and/or complete transactions. Each participant is then asked a few follow up questions focusing on overall satisfaction with the site and the experience it provided.
 
The key advantages of remote usability testing are the following:
 
* Fits with a agile way of working
* Results can be gathered quickly
* Relatively cheap compared with conducting face to face user testing
* Removes moderator bias

##Weaknesses/when not to use

Although this type of remote usability testing can provide depth of content, the lack of moderation can result in respondents veering off topic and the analysis be quite lengthy. Also, respondents can sometimes appear to be ‘professional testers’, and therefore can perform tasks with greater ease than other users.
 

##No./Types of participants

Testing is normally conducted using the online panel that is available through the panel company. As with regular lab based testing, it is recommended that you test with 8-12 users.
 
 
##Cost
 
This type of research is very cheap - approximately £150-£200.
 
##Timescales
 
Set up, fieldwork, and analysis can be achieved in one day.

##Examples

This has been used to test the User Strategy website.
