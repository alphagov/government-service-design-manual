##Where/how you might use it##

Online tools are a good way in which to conduct in-house research cheaply and effectively. Conducting research in-house enables user research teams get closer to the data, and have a good understanding of the user. This is, however, dependent on teams having adequate resource to enable analysis to be conducted properly and fed back to the relevant teams.

##Weaknesses/when not to use##

Using online research tools in-house can be cheaper that assigning a third party agency to conduct the work, however, as pointed out above, this is dependent of user research teams having adequate resource.

##No./Types of participants##

Participants can be obtained internally through websites, emails, and other user channels, or via third party sample companies.

##Cost##

Some tools are free, but licences for others can range from Â£15k to 20k.

##Timescales##

Research can be conducted quickly as little set up time is required.
