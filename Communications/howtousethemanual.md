#How to use the Manual

This short guide to the [Government Service Design Manual](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/) describes how you can use it for your projects, and what kind of feedback we’ll need to take into our Beta.

Remember, this site is an ‘alpha’ prototype. The guidance, reporting tool and criteria are incomplete, and shouldn’t yet be considered the canonical versions.

##Overview
[This short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIJgGTOCR3g) describes the Manual, and what each section does. Alternatively, read the short descriptions of each section below.

##The standard
![Screen shot of the standard](http://alphagov.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-07-at-15-45-03-e1357574998464.png)

The [Digital by Default standard](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/standard/) is a list of criteria that services and teams must meet before they go live. This list is very much under discussion, but it gives you a sense of what’s currently under consideration.

Creating a standard for services to meet was [one of the actions in the Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard), and that includes things like basing development around users needs, iterating a service based on feedback, and making plans to meet key performance indicators.

##The projects

The [projects page](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/projects/) shows you a list of what’s being worked on across government right now. It’s been populated with some of the exemplar projects the team at GDS are currently helping to scope or deliver.

When you click on a project, you can see more detail about what the team is working on. [The page being filled in by the Digital by Default team](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/projects/1/) is a good example of how to complete these.

The page shows you who is currently working on the tool, and you can read more about using this feature [below](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/194/#c6).

##The guidance
![Screen shot of the guidance home](http://alphagov.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-07-at-15-45-48-e1357574909251.png)

The [guides and toolkits](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/) are a pool of knowledge about how to build digital by default services. It contains code and copy for people to reuse, as well as advice about how to build features and the reasons for it.

When it’s released, teams across government will be able to contribute new approaches and tools. For now it’s been populated by GDS staff. 

Not every heading is full of content - around half of the guidance has been returned at time of writing - but if you want to see good examples of guidance then take a look at the pages about [Colour palettes](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/180/) or [Online research panels](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/157/).

##The community tab

Finally, [the community section](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/community/) will help users see what other teams are working on. 

This is the least well-defined section of the alpha, but it’s clear from early testing that users do want the means of asking questions of teams working on these problems throughout government. We need feedback about what will be most useful for your team(s) here.

##How to register/log in
To start using the Manual you’ll need to register an account. To do this follow these steps:

1. If you do not already have one, create an account on [github.com](http://github.com)
2. Return to the Manual, and click the 'Sign in' link on the top right of the page
3. Sign in using your Github account details
4. Email the digital default team (dbd-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we will add you to the appropriate project

##Filling in project reports
Project reports are the place that teams record and share their progress against the standard for each stage of the project.

To add a report, click the 'Add report' link, then fill in the details of what the team has done. For example, under 'Testing the service' you would add the findings from user research and other feedback.

##Sending feedback

We would love to get feedback on your experiences of using the Government Service Manual.

Please send us your thoughts by the 31st of January: (dbd-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

We will use your feedback to help build the beta version of this tool. 

Some guiding questions...

**The Standard**

* Is 'the Standard' page enough to tell you about Digital by Default?
* What would you like to see in this area?
* We are considering providing a lens view so that information relevant to the role of person logged in is most prominently displayed. Would this be useful to you?
* This section could link through to relevant pieces of guidance. Is this something you would like to see? Or is there anything else you would require here?


**Projects**

* Is this straightforward to fill in?
* Do the headings make sense?
* Is the purpose of the project overview and project journal clear or do they need more explanation?
* How would you like to see progress displayed?
* What would you like GDS to do in terms of monitoring and feeding back?


**Guidance**

* Is the guidance easy to navigate?
* Would you like to see the guidance structured in any other way?
* Is there any other guidance you want to see in the guidance?
* Would you like access to additional help from these pages?


**Community and Help**

* What would you like to see in this section?
