# Contributing to the Government Service Design Manual

In the spirit of open source, we welcome contributions to the service manual. These can be as trivial as fixing typos or grammatical errors, to suggesting new areas of guidance.

We will review your submission and may suggest amendments via the comments system. However, we are not obliged to accept all contributions and will maintain editorial control over the manual.

## Process
Submissions of guidance or revisions should be made as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Each piece of new or heavily revised guidance will be reviewed by a content specialist, who will make sure it stays true to the GOV.UK style as well as the spirit of the manual.

Once guidance has been submitted it will stay open as a pull request for a few days so that teams throughout GDS and beyond get a chance to review and comment.

Remember to:

* [write helpful commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* check the GOV.UK [style guide](/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) and [content design guidance](/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#writing-to-govuk-style) for tips on how to write to our standard
* make sure that new guidance has been shared with the relevant people before being submitted
