# Contributing to the Government Service Design Manual

In the spirit of open source, we welcome contributions to the service manual. These can be as trivial as fixing typos or grammatical errors, to suggesting new areas of guidance.

We will review your submission and may suggest amendments via the comments system. However, we are not obliged to accept all contributions and will maintain editorial control over the manual.

## Language and style

## Commits and pull requests

- Please [write helpful commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- Please don't include your name or initials in the commit message â€” this is already catered for by Git's `author` value
