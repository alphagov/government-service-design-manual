#Transactional microcopy
<p>Microcopy includes the questions and common text you may use throughout a service.  </p>

##Guidance
<p>Don’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;please&rsquo; on labels - give polite, clear, short instruction
<li>colons after labels DESIGN
<li>Don&rsquo;t add &lsquo;your&rsquo; to labels etc, for example: your name, your address etc, use &lsquo;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;address&rsquo;, unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: &lsquo;your name&rsquo;, ‘partner name&rsquo; etc
</li>

<p>Use:</p>
<li>sentence case 
<li>address the user directly 
<li>the cap convention in the style guide [link]
</li>

<p>Style:</p>
<li>first name - not Christian name
<li>last name - not family name
<li>middle name(s)
<li>age
<li>date of birth - in full, not DOB
</li>

###Help text
<p>There are 3 levels of text:</p>
<strong>On-page help</strong>
<p>One line under the label that will help the user to fill in that field. Example: 

<strong>Show/hide</strong>
<p>Use an expandable show/hide box for actions like: &lsquo;If you don't have....&rsquo; or &lsquo;Where to find your Unique Tax Reference Number&rsquo;</p>

<strong>Light box</strong>
<p>Only use a light box for help if you are explaining a concept or part of a process - don't use it for explaining any part of the service. </p>


###Radio buttons
<p>Use: Yes [button] No [button] (note caps)</p>
<p>Keep to the same convention (yes first) on the page.</p>
