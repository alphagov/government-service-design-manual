The [ICT Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-government-ict-strategy-resources) committed the government to developing and implementing an [end user device strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/end-user-device-strategy). This strategy has aimed to address historic issues, including user tools that do not meet user needs, degrade civil service productivity, and provide poor user experiences. These issues have been compounded by:

* overly expensive end user devices and associated services
* an inability to change user IT to meet user needs
* a growing divergence from the modern user-friendly consumer IT being exploited in other sectors
* an entrenchment of incumbent products and suppliers through technical and commercial dependencies or “lock in”.

##The mandate for change

The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Civil-Service-Reform-Plan-acc-final.pdf) requires departments to address “frustrating” IT tools for civil servants. A Workplace Transformation programme will streamline working practises, supported by effective IT.

The Government Protective Marking Scheme Review and resultant Security Classification Policy, together with the [Open Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles) policy, require a reform of the principles by which IT tools for civil servants are designed, procured and managed. Civil servants are expected to take responsibility and apply reasonable judgement when dealing with information, removing the need for overbearing technical controls.

##Start with user needs

The [Government and Departmental Digital Strategies](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/) establish user needs as the central focus of digital services and tools. This requires a step change in agility to meet changing user needs, together with an excellent user experience.

We need to get 4 basic things right:

| Area | Approach |
|-----|-----|
| User Experience | We need to design services with users’ needs in mind – and that goes for our own technology as much as it does for what we deliver to the public |
| Proportionate Security | Security should be proportionate to the risk, and for the vast majority of government business, this means using controls in the same way that a well run commercial business would |
| Sustained Value | Making sure that value can be sustained after something has been bought. This means designing for change, and opening up access to all types of suppliers, including open source or small businesses |
| Consumerised IT | We need to make it possible to use the sort of general, commodity technology that works well for consumers, and for other businesses |

The [end user device strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/end-user-device-strategy) will help departments and suppliers understand what kinds of design decisions they should now be making.

There’s specific guidance on the standards that need to be met to ensure that digital services don’t become heavily dependent on particular products or suppliers, and a new security framework has been developed with CESG (the government’s specialist technology security advisors) for those working with government information across all types of mobile devices.
