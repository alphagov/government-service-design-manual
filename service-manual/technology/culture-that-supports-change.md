Your digital services and the technology upon which they are built should enable change to happen, giving you the freedom to evolve your services according to changing user needs, expectations and technology innovation.

Improving the way that you deliver digital services is more about cultural and behavioural change than it is about IT. Technology alone will not be able to improve public services.

##What does good look like?

Your digital services are based on user needs, not on organisation structures and processes.

You have:

* a [team](/service-manual/the-team) that is knowledgeable about existing and emerging technology options
* a governance and management structure that is an enabler, not a bottleneck or barrier to change
* flexible commercial models that meet your needs, eg commodity or utility provision
* a diverse, competitive market from which to [choose your suppliers or products](/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html)
* transparency and trust in your supplier relationships
* pricing competition and the ability to switch between alternative suppliers

##What you might need to change

To deliver better public services you’ll need to change existing behaviours and cultures and successfully transition to new ways of working. You may need to develop the skills within your team and keep up to date on new methods and technologies. It may also be necessary to change your physical [working environment](/service-manual/the-team/working-environment.html) to get the best out of your team.

You may need to radically change governance and management structures and will need to run projects in a more [agile](/service-manual/agile/index.html) way.

You will need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have found through new procurement routes, such as the [G-Cloud](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/).

It may be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off previous financial investments, so you will need courage and conviction to stop spending on old, legacy systems.

The Cabinet Office, through the [IT spend controls](/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html), has a strong preference against extending contracts to support legacy systems. At the very least you will need an exit management strategy that sets out a plan for how you will significantly reduce any dependence on outdated technology.

The cost of maintaining out of date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html).

If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the [architecture](/service-manual/technology/architecture.html) and [hosting](/service-manual/operations/hosting.html) of your [existing estate](/service-manual/technology/architecture.html#the-legacy-estate) may need to be rethought.

##Breaking down barriers to technology change

You may come across inertia or resistance when you try to make necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided.

Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change – and the more successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be.

The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and delivered by those not encumbered by past success – new market entrants and those traditionally closed-out from government business, such as small- or medium-sized businesses.

You may find that you have become [locked-in](/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html#lock-in) to a particular contract or technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership of a particular solution, you should have estimated the cost of exit at the start of implementation.

If you try to move and find that cost is a barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated with the incumbent supplier/system and not be considered as part of the cost of a new solution.

Building on [open standards](/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html) or selecting products which use them will help you to avoid this problem in the future.

##Understanding fear, uncertainty and doubt

If you have incumbent suppliers, it is important that you understand and anticipate their likely reaction as they struggle to maintain the status quo and resist change.

Incumbent suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their business models and the way their business worked. They will be less certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of their market share and their exposure to genuine, open competition.

The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on their current business model. That will reinforce their internal resistance to change. It is difficult for them to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if obsolete, business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT products as commodities. The IT as utility market is not yet fully established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model might bring them higher profits on lower revenues.

You will also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff may have long grown accustomed to old ways of working. It is important that as a leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update their skills and experience. Some may have become dependent on external suppliers’ advice. Some may even have built their career on accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies.

##Why you need an environment that supports change

Flexible technology and services give service managers the ability evolve services and make them responsive to users needs. It also avoids costly and more risky big bang changes.

Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and support, or to old and inefficient IT, means that you have the ability to choose what best meets the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost and at a timescale that suits you.
