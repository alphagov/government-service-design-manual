Government needs services that are genuinely agile and responsive to changing needs – where change reduces, not raises, cost and risk – making government more productive, and our public services better. To do that, Chief Technology Officers (CTO) need to make major structural improvements to how IT is used and procured, alongside an approach which:

* focuses on user needs
* puts outcomes, not inputs first
* uses “openness” to our advantage – open data, open standards, open source, open markets
* ensures that IT becomes so good that our colleagues, citizens and businesses want to use it

Liam Maxwell, Chief Technology Officer of Her Majesty's Government,[wrote about the landscape CTOs are operating in](). It's essential reading for those transforming technology provision across government, describing the challenges and opportunities of this new approach.

##The technology code of practice
The [technology code of practice](/service-manual/technology/code-of-practice.html) describes the criteria that requests for funding will be judged against. The eighteen points describe a vision of technology provision which can meet and adapt to the changing needs of users throughout government.

##Processes and controls
The [spending controls](/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html) process ensures that spending on IT and digital services meets the needs of users and provides good value for money.

##Changing culture
Delivering technology that meets the needs and expectations of users will require major changes to the culture and mindset of teams. That means:

* using [government as a platform](/service-manual/technology/government-as-a-platform.html)
* creating a [culture that supports change](/service-manual/technology/culture-that-supports-change.html)
* thinking of [security as an enabler](/service-manual/technology/security-as-enabler.html) for service transformation

##Services and devices

Understanding the interoperability of services and devices is crucial to being able to improve part or the whole of the technology provision for a team or service. You will need to:

* understand the [architecture](/service-manual/technology/architecture.html) of services and technology across team, departments and government
* provide [end user devices](/service-manual/technology/end-user-devices.html) which meet user needs
* have a good understanding of what effective [service integration](/service-manual/technology/service-integration.html) looks like
