<figure class="media-player-wrapper video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVuJPk8Kf3U">Liam Maxwell, Chief Technology Officer for government, describes the new approach to IT.</a></figure>

Government needs services that are genuinely agile and responsive to changing needs -- where change reduces, not raises, cost and risk -- making government more productive, and our public services better. To do that, Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) need to help government departments make major structural improvements to how technology is used and procured, alongside an approach which:

* concentrates on user needs
* puts outcomes, not inputs, first
* uses openness to our advantage -- open data, open standards, open source, open markets
* ensures that technology becomes so good that our colleagues, citizens and businesses want to use it

Liam Maxwell, Chief Technology Officer of the UK government, [wrote a post on the GDS blog about the landscape CTOs are operating in](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/05/21/rebalancing-tech-across-gov/). It's essential reading for those transforming technology provision across government, describing the challenges and opportunities of this new approach.

##The technology code of practice
The [technology code of practice](/service-manual/technology/code-of-practice.html) describes the criteria that requests for spending approval will be judged against. It describes a vision of technology provision which can meet and adapt to the changing needs of users throughout government.

##Processes and controls
The [spending controls](/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html) process ensures that spending on technology and digital services meets the needs of users and provides good value for money.

##Building on openness
There must be a level playing field for open source and proprietary software solution, that allows organisations the flexibility to change technologies and innovate based on data. This means:

* building on [open standards](/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html)
* building on [open data](/service-manual/technology/open-data.html)
* building on your own [API](/service-manual/making-software/apis.html)

##Changing culture
Providing technology that meets the needs and expectations of users will require major changes to the culture and mindset of teams. That means:

* defining services based on [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html)
* using [government as a platform](/service-manual/technology/government-as-a-platform.html)
* creating a [culture that supports change](/service-manual/technology/culture-that-supports-change.html)
* thinking of [security as an enabler](/service-manual/technology/security-as-enabler.html) for service transformation

##Services and devices
Understanding the interoperability of services and devices is crucial to being able to improve part or the whole of the technology provision for a team or service. You will need to:

* understand the [architecture](/service-manual/technology/architecture.html) of services and technology across team, departments and government
* provide [end user devices](/service-manual/technology/end-user-devices.html) which meet user needs
* have a good understanding of what effective [service integration](/service-manual/technology/service-integration.html) looks like
* understand the role of [GOV.UK Verify](/service-manual/identity-assurance/index.html) when providing services to citizens

*[CTOs]: Chief Technology Officers
