Organisations should follow the rules set out in [Managing Public Money](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_mpm_index.htm) which sets out the overriding principles for dealing with resources used by public sector organisations in the UK.

The HMG [Spend Controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1) supplement those rules with specific controls for spend in the following areas: Advertising and marketing and communications; Strategic Supplier Management, including disputes; Commercial models; ICT; Digital Service Delivery (including [identity assurance](/service-manual/identity-assurance)); External Recruitment; Consultancy; Redundancy and Compensation; Learning and Development; Property and Facilities Management.

## The process

A request for spend approval is likely to require a number of controls - most Digital and IT spend requests will also require Commercial Approval to ensure they are aligned to [government procurement policy](http://procurement.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/policy-capability/latest-policy-and-regulations/public-procurement-policy). Each department has a GDS account manager who will ensure that other areas of Cabinet Office are engaged as needed when considering a case. An online controls tool has been introduced to support this process and give full visibility on case progress.

The purpose of the IT and digital controls is to ensure that spending on IT is proportionate and directed at programmes and projects that meet the commonly agreed Digital and ICT strategies. It is an independent confirmation that the department has undertaken thorough consideration of the user need and value for money solution options.
