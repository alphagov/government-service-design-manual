Organisations should follow the rules set out in [Managing Public Money](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_mpm_index.htm) which sets out the overriding principles for dealing with resources used by public sector organisations in the UK.

The HMG [Spend Controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1) supplement those rules with specific controls for spend in the following areas: Advertising and marketing and communications; Strategic Supplier Management, including disputes; Commercial models; ICT; Digital Service Delivery (including [identity assurance](/service-manual/identity-assurance.html)); External Recruitment; Consultancy; Redundancy and Compensation; Learning and Development; Property and Facilities Management.

## The process

A request for spend approval is likely to require a number of controls - most Digital and IT spend requests will also require Commercial Approval to ensure they are aligned to [government procurement policy](http://procurement.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/policy-capability/latest-policy-and-regulations/public-procurement-policy). Each department has a GDS account manager who will ensure that other areas of Cabinet Office are engaged as needed when considering a case. An online controls tool has been introduced to support this process and give full visibility on case progress.

The purpose of the IT and digital controls is to ensure that spending on IT is proportionate and directed at programmes and projects that meet the commonly agreed Digital and ICT strategies. It is an independent confirmation that the department has undertaken thorough consideration of the user need and value for money solution options. The controls process has changed over time to ensure:

* greater public and market transparency and two-way engagement through publishing business needs and subsequent decisions towards a solution
* greater emphasis on problem exploration, solution discovery and market engagement activity before any formal procurement is initiated
* greater use of agile iterative development over linear waterfall delivery

## What will be examined

GDS will examine and challenge all technology-related spending over a certain threshold - no public commitment or expenditure should be made above these thresholds without prior approval. The thresholds are:

| £5 million | Full lifetime cost of the project |
| £1 million | Current or new back office / administrative systems, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, HR systems, Finance / Accounting systems, procurement systems. The control includes implementation, licensing and support costs, as well as any extension to those services |
| £100k | Common Infrastructure Solutions for the Public Sector Network (PSN) |
| £0 (no lower limit) | Spend on digital projects |

These thresholds cover all technology expenditure, including:

- contracts (including contract amendments, extensions or renewals)
- licences
- expenditure through existing frameworks
- feasibility and/or proof of concept studies
- pilots
- projects (or an element of a project) and programmes
- ‘business as usual’ changes or enhancements or maintenance or refreshes
- common infrastructure solutions including voice and data communications, Public Services Networks (PSN) whether fixed or mobile.

They also cover programmes that are broken into smaller chunks or projects, which individually are below the thresholds, but which in aggregate are above them. Intentionally breaking down a programme into smaller elements to avoid the controls process is itself a serious breach of the controls.

## Starting the process

Departments should engage early with GDS to agree the appropriate points for approval, before the first approval is needed (usually after the discovery phase, at Strategic Outline Case or before a Prior Information Notice is issued).  This early engagement will avoid departments proceeding too far without approval and reduces the risk of irregular expenditure.

Full details of current requirements are detailed in the [Cabinet Office ICT Spend Control Form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1) (currently V.2.18).  You can start the process by e-mailing [gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:GDSspendapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). If your request contains ‘Restricted’ information it should be sent to [ictspendapproval@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:ictspendapproval@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk).

If your project cost exceeds your department’s main delegated authority set by Treasury it will be classed as a Major Project and you will also need to engage with Cabinet Office’s [Major Projects Authority (MPA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/126). A Major Project is defined as “a central Government funded project or programme that requires HM Treasury approval during its life, as set out in Delegated Authority letters”. The [guidance](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/major_projects_approvals_assurance_guidance.PDF) describes the Treasury Approval process and Major Projects Assurance process including creation of an [Integrated Assurance and Approval Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61374/MPA_20Guidance.pdf) (IAAP), which will document the approvals needed through the lifecycle of the project.

Digital projects will also be assessed for compliance to the service standard – as described in the flowchart below:

![Compliance flowchart](/service-manual/assets/images/spending-controls/flowchart.png)

The controls process will have slight differences if your project is following an iterative approach or a waterfall approach. All digital projects will follow an iterative approach, and you will need to engage early with GDS to define the approvals your project needs. Below is an example of how this might look:

## Mapping controls to Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live Stages

![Mapping controls to Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live Stages](/service-manual/assets/images/spending-controls/agile.png)

The approach to agile delivery consists of three key phases:

* Discovery - explore user need validity, nature of problem and solution approaches
* Iterate - iterative development of alpha, beta solutions, progressively gaining further insight into live solution
* Live - live solution, and refinement through iterative changes and feedback from usage

The key evidence documents are:

1. **Strategic Outline Case** is developed once the discovery phase has provided insight into the problem, solution approaches, risks and benefits. It contains:
  - total budget envelope, including subset proposed for alpha solutions
  - evidence that agile is optimal approach
2. **Outline Business Case** can be completed based on information gathered during the development of early alpha solutions. It contains:
  - activities proposed for beta solution
  - subset of budget for beta solution development
3. **Full Business Case** – The development of beta solutions will provide sufficient certainty to complete a Full Business Case. It will contain:
  - activities for live build
  - activities for post-live refinement and management information
  - proposed budget for live and post-live development
4. **Post Implementation Review** – outcomes and performance report, supplier assessment, lessons learned and shared.
