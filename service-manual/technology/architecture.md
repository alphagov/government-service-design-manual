Architecture is not just about the design and deployment of technology -- to be successful you need to consider the utility, sustainability and attractiveness of the system as a whole. 
 
 We need to build an architecture where the consistency and overall clarity of form is sufficiently 
 persuasive and useful that a user can engage with government without understanding the details of policy or
 departmental organisation. We need to be able to build services without repetition, 
 where services are focused on user need, and common elements are shared throughout.
