The Government Digital Strategy set an ambitious target for teams building services: services so good that people prefer to use them.

## Putting users first

Building good services means meeting the needs of users. 82% of the UK population is online. They have high expectations for what makes a good digital service, whether it's from a bank, a travel agent, a retailer or a broadcaster, and when services don't meet those standards they let the people responsible know.

Government needs to learn from teams who are building successful, world class services. They're placing users at the heart of their decisions, incorporating their feedback at every step of the way.

## A new way of doing things

Typically, government services are built after long, costly procurement processes. 

In this way of working, users are seldom - if ever - consulted. The first time the public might see a service is when it goes live, by which time it's too late to make any changes.

Instead, teams need to constantly iterate against user feedback.

This means building and testing in small chunks, working quickly to deliver improvements to a service. Teams will work out how to best meet the needs of users, releasing code regularly and working in an agile way.

## Essential reading

The GDS design principles present a clear vision of how delivery teams can think about designing digital by default services. These should be a touchstone for every member of a delivery team.

The Government Digital Strategy sets out the context we are working in. The departmental responses to the strategy contain a detailed breakdown of which services in particular will be tackled first.

And the Digital by Default Service Standard lists the criteria against which all new and redesigned services will be judged from April 2014.
