Any business case made for continuous series of posts that are relevant to the work of a team or organisation is likely to be accepted. Continuity is important: a few interesting articles do not make a blog by themselves (though they may be posts on a blog). Creating a new blog is a commitment to sustaining it over time, and needs resources allocated to a flow of new posts, comments and reader engagement.

Examples are the GDS blog, existing departmental and agency blogs moving to GOV.UK as part of departmental transition, and service teams that are blogging their progress towards meeting the Digital by Default Service Standard. For the latter, the blog will be an essential source of evidence for when services are reviewed on whether they have met the standard ahead of being launched on GOV.UK.

Authorship

The author will always be a named, registered user of the GOV.UK blogging platform (with an exception for one-off ‘guest’ bloggers, where a generic team author account can be used). Authors will write the post (for an intended audience), add links, source images, add any attributions required and oversee comment discussions (supported by the comment guidelines below). As standard, they will create the post and add links and images within the blogging platform.

Coordination

Coordination is not just the checking that blog posts contain timely, relevant, tailored content and that the principles above are applied consistently, but also the planning and timing of blogging within wider narratives. Departments will be responsible for the coordination of their own blogs. 

Moderation & usage

As with coordination, moderation will need to be taken on by departments for their own blogs. 

Below are examples of the approaches that are used by the Government Digital Service for its own blog and should provide useful guidance on the issues to consider when developing guidance for departmental or other blogs:

GDS is part of the Cabinet Office, and use of this site is governed by the Cabinet Office website’s terms & conditions and privacy policy.
Guidelines for commenters:
be respectful of others who use this site
stay on topic
do not use language that is offensive, inflammatory or provocative (this includes, but is not limited to, swearing and obscene or vulgar comments)
do not break the law (this includes libel, condoning illegal activity and contempt of court)
do not use this site for party political purposes (this site is paid for with public money so it’s inappropriate to engage in party political activity)
please do not post personal information in comments such as addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details, which may relate to you or other individuals
do not impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or an organisation
do not make any commercial endorsement or promotion of any product, service or publication not relevant to the discussion
If you are aged 16 or under, please get the permission of your parent or guardian before participating. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate.
Moderation policy
Blog comments are pre-moderated to check they comply with the GDS guidelines for commenters above. If comments don’t comply they will not be published.

This is how we evaluate comments:
Is the comment on topic, does it add value to the discussion and can GDS answer publicly?
If so, approve it, and post a timely response within 24 hours.
Is this person asking for information or detail relating to another GDS channel, e.g. is it a GOV.UK content query or an issue with a tool, transaction, bug or performance problem?
If so, we’ll pass the query on and ensure it is dealt with as quickly as possible, and tell the user that this has been done. We will update the user on progress. If it adds value to the comment thread then this exchange can be added as open comments.
Is this comment a rant at GDS venting frustration or anger?
If so, monitor and discuss with the GDS communications team first.
Pingbacks - references to links made to our blog - are also pre-moderated. Where the context of the link adds value to the discussion, the pingback will be posted to the comments thread. Collections of “interesting links” don’t generally pass this test of adding value.
