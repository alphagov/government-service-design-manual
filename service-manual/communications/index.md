Service teams moving through the development process will want to make sure that users and stakeholders know about any changes to how they interact with government transactions.

As many such redesigns are still in the early stages, guidance about talking about them is still evolving.

In the meantime, you can read about:

* [using blogs to report on a service's progress](/service-manual/communications/blogs.html)
* how [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html) will be measured for every service, how to [increase digital take-up](/service-manual/communications/increasing-digital-takeup.html) and digital take up case studies. 
* engaging with [users during development](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research)
* talking to stakeholders to anticipate the needs of [assisted digital users](/service-manual/assisted-digital)
