Blogs are a simple, effective way of keeping a record of the work a team is doing on a service.

Updates can be as short as you like, allowing you to tell readers about subtle changes to a service’s design or new features added to a tool, while also offering you a platform for longer pieces of writing that describe significant changes to policy or approach.

The [Inside GOV.UK blog](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/) and the [MOJ Digital blog](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/) are great examples of how teams are already talking about their work in the open.

##Publish, don’t send

A good blog post can do the work of dozens of emails. Finding the right way of sharing a piece of information once -- [describing a change to how a feature works](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/08/07/the-future-of-detailed-guides/) for example, or [talking about upcoming work](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/09/23/coming-in-this-sprint-featuring-on-topics-changes-to-html-publications-and-more/) -- can save a huge amount of effort in finding new ways of saying roughly the same thing.

More importantly, it means there’s a consistent frame of reference for talking about a subject. If people have been told slightly different things then they might come away with a different understanding of how something works -- not something likely to make your life simpler, clearer and faster.

##Get to the point

Whatever you’re writing about, make sure the most important information is in the title and the opening sentence. Readers may only see the summaries of your posts on the home page, or their feed reader, or in the email alerts, and it’s important they have a clear understanding of what you’re doing.

##Little and often

Short updates can still go into a bit of detail about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, whether that’s changing the colour of a button or re-writing a whole section of guidance. Keeping posts short makes them simpler to write, and also means it’ll be easier to get input from the people you work with.

Though the frequency with which you blog will often vary you should aim to publish a new post at least once a week.

##Illustrate everything

A well-chosen illustration or photo can add important context or information for your readers. The GOV.UK blogging platform is fairly flexible. You can embed tweets, slide decks and videos as well as images, all media that make your message just [a little bit easier to comprehend](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/09/11/prototyping-browse-and-navigation/).

##Use the style guidance...

The GOV.UK [content design guidance](/guidance/content-design/blogging#style-and-tone-of-voice) is an invaluable tool for writers. They’re full of carefully researched tips for clear, concise prose which seeks to make your writing easier to understand.

In particular, make use of subheadings and bullet points within your blog posts to make them quicker to read. And make use of the [‘words to avoid’ list](/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#words-to-avoid) -- it’s there to make sure writers stay clear no matter the audience.

##...but remember you’re a person

The style guide doesn’t mean you can’t be warm, candid or personal. You should be all of these things.

It’s important that you’re accountable for the things you write. If your name appears on a post then you should be prepared to respond to comments and engage in dialogue both on your blog and on other social networks. It’ll improve your work, and ultimately improve the experience for your users

##Always get someone to read it first

It’s a given that writers will be professional and mindful of things like the [Civil Service Code](/government/publications/civil-service-code) when they blog, but you should always get someone to read your work over before you hit PUBLISH.

For starters, they’ll probably spot a few mistake that have slipped your notice, but they might also be able to offer a different perspective on the things you’re writing about.
