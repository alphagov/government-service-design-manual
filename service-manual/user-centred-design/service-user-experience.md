The [service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-13) states that you should build your service to be “consistent with the user experience of the rest of GOV.UK by using the design patterns.”

The first place to start is by reading our [design principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). These will help you to understand how we approach design. You should keep these in mind when designing and building your service, always thinking about how to make the service simpler, clearer and faster.

## Designing your service

### Alpha

At alpha stage, the important thing is to make something and make it quickly, before testing it with real users. You should follow the design principles and should spend your time working on the user journey, interface and experience, but you don’t need to worry about making everything pixel perfect in your prototype.

### Beta

At beta the main priority is creating a simpler, clearer, faster service. You should concentrate on making the user journey and experience as simple and clear as possible. However, you should  be moving towards a finalised look and feel, how fast you achieve this depends on the size of your design team and how much time you can dedicate to it.

### Live

Before your service goes live it must look and feel like GOV.UK.  You should be using the correct typography, header and footer and if necessary should have followed the guidance on pictures and icons.

Throughout the process of creating your service you should refer to the design principles, think of the user and design for simplicity. The user experience across all services on GOV.UK should be consistent.

## Using the GOV.UK logo

Your service is on GOV.UK if it's either at `www.gov.uk/myservice`, `myservice.service.gov.uk` or `myblog.blog.gov.uk`. At the point of launch it should look like GOV.UK and should have the GOV.UK logotype, including the crown.

You can still follow the guidance if your service isn’t on GOV.UK, but your site shouldn’t identify as being part of GOV.UK and shouldn't use the crown or the GOV.UK logotype in the header. This blog post talks about a good example of [a site that follows our design patterns](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/03/18/intranets-dcms/) without using the logo.

## Typography

Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information.

You'll be given access to the New Transport typeface if your service is on GOV.UK.

[The GOV.UK elements page](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/elements/index.html) has more information about typography.

## Pictures and icons

In most cases your service will not need to use pictures.

You should only use icons if they are clear, simple and help to convey information more clearly than text alone could.

## Header and footer

You should use the standard template for your header and footer if your service is on GOV.UK.
