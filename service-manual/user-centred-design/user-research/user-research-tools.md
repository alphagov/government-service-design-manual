There are a number of good tools that can help user research teams conduct in-house research quickly and effectively. Below is a high level overview of what these enable, for people unfamiliar with user testing.

Online tools are a good way in which to conduct in-house research cheaply and effectively. Conducting research in-house enables user research teams get closer to the data, and have a good understanding of the user. This is, however, dependent on teams having adequate resource to enable analysis to be conducted properly and fed back to the relevant teams.

>Please note: Examples are illustrative, rather than recommendations, and we suggest checking G-Cloud regularly to see if any similar services are available using that framework.

## Survey tools

These enable the easy creation of online surveys. Features include a scripting tool that allows easy creation of different question types, the ability to add branding, advanced branching, automated reporting, automatic activation/pop script, email links etc.

Some good tools are available free, however, these often have restrictions on the number of questions you can ask, the number of completes you can collect, and advance features such as API, and branding. Examples include [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), [Survey Expression](http://www.surveyexpression.com/), [Smart Survey](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/) and [Fluid Surveys](http://fluidsurveys.com/).

## Remote user testing tools

These tools enable user research teams to conduct remote usability testing in-house. These tools allow you to script the surveys easily, while also conduct the analysis to be conducted relatively simply and quickly.

Most of these tools also enable you to conduct standard online surveys within the same software package. Examples include [Keynote Webeffective](http://www.keynote.com/solutions/analytics), and [User Zoom](http://www.userzoom.co.uk/).

## Card sorting tools

These tools enable user research teams to conduct online card sorting in-house. Card sorting tools usually come as part of a larger survey package. Examples include [User Zoom](http://www.userzoom.co.uk/) and [Optimal Workshop](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm).

## Online focus groups

Enable in-house research teams to conduct focus groups online. Most also enable you to run 1:1 sessions, auto ethnography, diary studies, and micro communities. Examples include [LiveMinds](http://www.liveminds.co.uk/) and [VisionsLive](http://www.visionslive.com/).

## Community groups

Enables in-house research team to manage a community of users and/or stakeholders. These normally come part of a larger online research tools package. Examples include [LiveMinds](http://www.liveminds.co.uk/) and [Bloomfire](https://bloomfire.com/).

## Text analysis tool

Enables the analysis of large amounts of written feedback -- via email, helpdesk etc. This software enables you to sort user feedback into themes, and make it easier to action. Examples include [Feedback Ferret](http://www.feedbackferret.com/) and [Atlas](http://atlasti.com/).
