Online Omnibus surveys are an effective way of interviewing a representative number of people, in a short period of time, and for a relatively low cost. Omnibus surveys of this type use an online panel to gather the sample and, as with regular offline Omnibus surveys, costs are kept down by collating questions on a variety of subjects from a number of clients.

## Where and how you might use it

Omnibus panels are ideal when you have key questions that you want answering, and need to reach a representative number of people quickly and cheaply.

## Weaknesses and when not to use

An omnibus survey is not appropriate when there are too many questions required. This would result in the survey being too long (combined with questions from other clients).

## Timescales

An online Omnibus panel can be conducted relatively quickly, with most companies running surveys twice a week with data delivered 4 days after survey goes in to field. Some companies offer an ‘on demand’ service where surveys can start any time, although a minimum number of questions is normally required.
