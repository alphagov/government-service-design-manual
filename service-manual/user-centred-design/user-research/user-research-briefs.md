A Research brief is a document written to explain research requirements and enable research to be procured via third party agencies. A research brief will outline the research objectives, and why the work is required.

Agencies respond to the brief and recommend suitable ways to conduct the work, and address the research objectives.

## What it should contain

A brief should contain the following information:

**Background** -- this should include a background of the organisation that wants to conduct the research, what relevant research has been conducted previously (or is being conducted), and the overall need for the piece of research that’s being procured.

**Business objectives** - this should include an explanation of the business objectives that the research is addressing. This is essential as it explains why the research is required by the business.

**Research objectives** - the research objectives should outline what the research is trying to achieve.

**Target Audience/Participants** - this should identify who you want to talk to, and focus on the target audience for the product/service. It is also common to include key demographic information, and where, geographically, the research is to be conducted.

**Preferred Approach/Methodology** - it is recommended that research agencies consider the objective of the research and recommend the most suitable methodology, however, it is common practice for in-house research teams to provide an idea of how they think the research could be conducted.

**Cost** - this section should state the budget available for the research. It is suggested that research agencies should be asked to provide a range of price options, so that insight teams can choose the most appropriate approach for their needs.

**Deliverables** - this should outline how the research is to be delivered eg presentation, workshop etc.

**Timings** - this should specify when the research is to be delivered.

**Project team** - this section should specify who is on the project team and their contact details.
