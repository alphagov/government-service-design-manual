Accessibility testing is very similar to [usability testing](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/index.html), in that it is about making sure that a product or service is easy for its intended audience to use. That audience includes users who access the service via a range of assistive technologies like:

* screen readers
* voice recognition software
* trackball devices

It’s important to consider a range of disabilities when you are testing any product or service, including those with:

* cognitive and learning disabilities, eg dyslexia or attention deficit disorders
* visual impairments, eg total and partial blindness, colour blindness, poor vision
* auditory disabilities, which can also affect language
* motor skills impairments, eg those affected by arthritis, strokes, RSI

The [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/introduction) came into force in 2010 and is intended to stop discrimination against members of society who may be unfairly treated due to age, disability, race, religion or sexual orientation.

You have a duty to [make adjustments for disabled persons](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/2/crossheading/adjustments-for-disabled-persons) so that they're not excluded from your service, making every reasonable attempt to provide access.

The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has a [useful guide to the UK law](http://www.rnib.org.uk/services-we-offer-advice-professionals/equality-act-compliance) and how it affects the accessibility of your site or service.

## Carrying out accessibility testing

Most accessibility testing is typically done after an accessibility audit has been conducted.

If a participant has a range of needs it’s best to do accessibility testing in the participant’s own home. This is because:

* they'll often have things set up to suit their individual needs
* it'll make the whole process less stressful for them, eg not having to travel or change environment

## When not to use it

It’s often difficult to carry out accessibility testing early on in the process of service design. Your service must be fairly stable for it to be evaluated by people using assistive technologies, eg a screen reader will read out the contents of a web page, so the code needs to be well structured.

Only do accessibility testing when:

* real content is in place, rather than ‘dummy text’ -- this is so it can be properly assessed by those with any cognitive or learning difficulties
* interactive elements, such as calls to action, hyperlinks, forms etc are in place -- this is so it can be properly assessed by those with motor skill impairments

## Accessibility audits

Full lab-based accessibility testing is not necessary for every project. An accessibility audit may be a more efficient and cost-effective way to review your service, depending on your typical user needs.

Accessibility audits are an alternative to standard accessibility testing. An accessibility audit involves an accessibility expert reviewing your site or service, highlighting all accessibility issues and making recommendations for fixing them.

They would typically use assistive software used by disabled web users (eg a screen reader) to effectively carry out the audit. See the [W3C accessibility guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) for further information.

Accessibility audits are cheaper and quicker than accessibility testing, but rely primarily on the expertise of the person doing them.

## Types of participants

Include disabled participants as part of a wider user testing recruitment process. The numbers will be small, but aim to capture a range of disabilities and assistive technologies.

## Cost

Disabled participants are a harder to reach audience, so the cost of recruiting participants can be relatively expensive. Recruit participants through specialist organisations or agencies like the [RNIB](http://www.rnib.org.uk/).

Expect costs to increase if:

* participants are travelling to your testing location
* participants require specialist assistance with carers or travel

## Timescales

Timings will vary, eg whether sessions are lab-based or structured in a ‘home environment’, but generally:

* recruitment via an agency can take up to 2 weeks, depending on the target audience
* testing sessions can take between 2-3 days depending on the number of participants
* analysis and reporting will take up to a week

These estimates are dependent on your project's scope, and the availability of testing assets.
