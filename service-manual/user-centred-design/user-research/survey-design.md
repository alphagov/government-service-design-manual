The abundance of free survey tools makes it cheap and easy for user research teams to produce their own surveys. However, thought still needs to be given to the survey design, understanding the goal(s) of the survey , and how the results will be used.

## What to consider when creating a survey

In order to increase the effectiveness of the survey, it is important to include an introduction that explains the purpose of the survey to potential respondents. Make it clear what the survey will be used for, and how it will help improve the service.

As it’s unlikely that it will be possible to include monetary incentives, it’s important the introduction is worded in a manner that increases the likelihood that people will want to take part. It is also recommended that people are informed of how long the survey will take to complete as this will reduce drop out rate (people who start the survey but don’t finish).

### Questions

Screener questions should be placed at the beginning of surveys to ensure that the correct people take the survey eg demographic information, reason for visiting etc. Quotas may also be set so that you can control the number of people taking the survey that fall into a specific demographic group or audience type.

A typical user survey will be structured in the following manner:

* introduction -- purpose of the survey, why it’s important that people take part.
* screener questions
* KPI questions -- [questions that benchmark performance](/service-manual/measurement/index.html)
* follow up demographic questions -- additional respondent information eg working/not working, salary, location etc

### Common survey question types

Surveys are normally composed of the following types of questions:

**Single response** (these type of questions allow the respondent to select just one answer)

eg:

Q. What is your gender?

*  Male
*  Female
*  Prefer not to answer

**Multiple choice questions** (respondents can select more than one answer)

eg:

Q. Why did you visit more than one area of the site today (please tick all that apply)?

*  Was visiting the site for more than one reason
*  Information I was looking for was spread over more than one area of the site
*  Couldn't find what I was looking for in one area, so went into other areas
*  Stumbled into other interesting areas of the site
*  Just browsing other areas of the site
*  Other (please specify)

**Open ended questions** (respondents can write a text response)

Q. You rated 'ease of using the site' as fair or poor. Please tell us why you gave this rating?

**Scale questions** (respondents are asked if they agree/disagree with a statement)

Q. The site was easy to use

*  Strongly agree
*  Agree
*  Neither agree nor disagree
*  Disagree
*  Strongly disagree
*  Don't know

Once you have decided on the questions that you want to be included, it is necessary to set up the question logic so that respondents are routed through the questionnaire correctly.

It is recommended that all surveys are tested thoroughly to ensure the correct data data is collected.
