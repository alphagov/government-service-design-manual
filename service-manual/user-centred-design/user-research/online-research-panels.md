An online panel is a collection of pre-recruited research participants who have agreed to take part in online research over a period of time. Members of the panels are incentivised to take part, and normally rewarded through vouchers, or points that have a monetary value.
As members of the panel are pre-recruited it means that they can be easily targeted by demographic, ownership and lifestyle information. As well as regular consumer panels, some companies also run business panels.

## Where and how you might use them

Online panels are used to target representative samples of people easily, cheaply and quickly. They can also be useful to target hard to reach groups, who would otherwise be impossible to reach within a realistic timeframe.

## When not to use

Respondents completing research in the shortest amount of time is a common problem, as this indicates that they have not given full consideration to the research that they are taking part in. Most panel companies reduce this prospect by monitoring how respondents complete the research (by time completion, and by the way they answer certain questions) and remove any suspicious respondents from their database. In addition to this, most panel companies will ensure that their respondents only complete four to six surveys a year.

## Timescales

As the sample is ‘on tap’ online panels can be used to turn round projects very quickly. When used for remote user testing, fieldwork is normally complete within three to four days.
