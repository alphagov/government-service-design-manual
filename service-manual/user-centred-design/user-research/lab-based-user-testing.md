User testing is a ‘qualitative’ research method, used to gauge how easy and intuitive a (product, service, website) is to use and whether it supports the needs of its intended audience.

## How lab-based user testing works

From a traditional perspective, user testing measures how well participants respond in the key areas of:

* efficiency
* accuracy
* recall
* emotional response

This approach is combined with more ‘qualitative’ techniques to help understand the users’ motivations and attitudes as well.

A product or service is usually assessed by asking small samples of the target audience to complete specific but realistic tasks in one to one sessions. The facilitator observes how well the participants are able to complete those tasks, noting down the areas or features that cause the participant problems.

Often the facilitator will ask participants to think aloud whilst completing those tasks in order to understand their decision processes better.

User testing can be conducted on low-fi assets (eg paper prototypes, wireframes) and hi-fi assets, including working prototypes and live digital services. It’s most effective when conducted early within the lifecycle of a product but can be conducted towards the end of the service lifecycle to validate any usability improvements.

## Where and how you might use it

A lab environment can provide a more formal setting for conducting sessions, with most spaces offering viewing facilities enabling stakeholders and key team members to watch the sessions in real time.

## Weaknesses and when not to use

Usability testing is best suited to finding the big issues, essentially the problems that affect users trying to perform tasks. However, it is qualitative in nature and is not statistically robust due to the small participant numbers, per round.

The lab environment may also be considered a weakness. It means testing is conducted in a very different space to that a user will commonly be in.

This method is not an appropriate for understanding user behaviour or user needs eg what they might want from a product or service.

## Number and types of participants

Between 5-8 participants, per round of user testing is sufficient to highlight the majority of usability issues. The key is to test often.
