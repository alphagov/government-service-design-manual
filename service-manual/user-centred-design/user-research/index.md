This guidance provides a broad overview of the methods and techniques available to conduct user research. More detailed guidance on each of these techniques can be found in the links below.

User research can be categorised into 2 broad themes -- product research and strategic research.

## Product research

Product research can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative techniques.

Qualitative techniques are intensive and often small scale. These include focus groups and one-to-one interviews, and are typically used to explore and analyse unstructured data.

Quantitative techniques involve higher-volume research, and include online surveys, face-to-face interviews, and involve a structured approach to data collection and analysis.

Product-based research can be conducted in-house or via a specialist agency. In-house approaches can be quicker as they involve less lead time (eg procurement), but require skilled in-house researchers, and can involve the procurement of some specialist software. 

Typically agencies are only used when specialist skills/experience is required that is not available in-house, and/or the scale of the project would mean it is difficult to provide dedicated internal resource.

## Strategic research

Strategic research also uses quantitative and qualitative methods, and is used to help understand the appetite for a product or service -- typically looking at the size of the market, trends, type of users etc.

Secondary data, also known as desk research, can be used, and involves the analysis of existing research or information sources. Ideally, secondary research should be conducted before embarking on any research project to understand what is already known, and what research is required to fill the knowledge gaps. This can range from published research, news article, or internal research that has been conducted previously.

## Research in the product's lifecycle

The table below illustrates the typical product lifecycle, showing the stages at which user research should be conducted. This chart can be used as a reference to ensure that user needs are being factored into design at every stage.

Typically this will involve some initial fact finding in the early stages to understand the user needs, including who they are, how they currently do things, how they’d like to do them, and what information is currently available.

| Discovery | Alpha | Beta | Live |
| Desk Research | Heuristic evaluation | Lab based testing | User surveys |
| Ethnography | Guerrilla testing | Remote usability testing | Remote usability testing |
| Focus Groups | | Focus groups | |

## Assisted digital research
Each service/product will have a different proportion of users who are not online and this will need to be considered when formulating an appropriate research approach for [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) users.

The services/product will need to consider the digital skills of their users to understand which users who currently don’t use digital channels:

* can’t ever use the digital service independently and will always need assisted digital support
* could use the digital service independently but will require initial assisted digital support to build their confidence in using the service
* should use the digital service (ie have the digital skills but currently use other channels) and don’t need assisted digital support

Some services, eg where users are large corporations, will not require assisted digital. The [Digital Landscape Research](/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) contains a demographic breakdown of who is offline and online and service teams and these techniques may be useful for doing user research.
