Discussion guides are used in order to ensure that focus groups and 1:1 interviews cover the required topics, and information is obtained from the sessions that will address the needs of the research.

## Where and how you might use them

In preparation for a focus group or 1:1 interview it is helpful to generate a list of questions that address the information that you're interested in obtaining from the sessions. These questions should be open ended, and structured in a manner that will help elicit information from respondents in a sensible flow.

As suggested by the name, discussion guides should be used as a guide to the discussion, and in comparison with a structured questionnaire, questions and areas for coverage should not read out verbatim. This enables the discussion to be led by respondents’ own experience.

Typically each section of the guide would include time guidance to ensure all areas can be covered and it should also indicate when stimulus is being used, and specify participants’ tasks.

Writing a discussion guide should be an iterative process, and once the initial draft has been written it is helpful to get input from other people on the project team.
