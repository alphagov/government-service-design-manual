Surveys contain closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide written responses.

## How surveys work

Surveys can be conducted either face to face by a trained moderator or through self-completion (online, postal etc) in order to quantify thoughts/beliefs, behaviours, ownership etc. Surveys can be a relatively cheap and quick way of gathering and quantifying public opinion and monitoring change over time.

Surveys can be used to size a market to find out how many people own a product, or take part in an activity eg how many people use the Internet in the UK. They can be also used to understand usage and attitudes towards a product or activity eg how often people use the Internet, how they access it, why the use it etc. Complex analysis can be also be conducted to understand key drivers of attitude/behaviour, segmentation of audiences, and trade offs between different opinions etc.

Surveys provide a snapshot of opinion, and are a useful method for monitoring uptake, usage and attitudes over time.

### Online web surveys

Self-completion surveys used to obtain information from web users. Surveys are activated when a user interacts with a page -- this can either be through arriving/leaving a page, or clicking on a link. Software is used to control the  proportion of users who are invited to take a specific survey. In order to increase completion rates, online surveys are normally no longer than 5 to 10 minutes in length (approximately 20 to 25 questions).

### Email survey

These are identical in set up and design to online web surveys, except participants are asked to complete them via an email, and not at random when they visit a website. Email surveys are often more targeted as participants can be identified by information already known about the them eg demographic, information usage etc.

Online or email surveys are normally the cheapest method as these can be conducted in-house using inexpensive or free survey software, inviting people to take part from their own website, or using a database of email addresses.

### Face to face interviews

Like telephone interviews, face to face interviews are structured and conducted by a trained moderator. Unlike other survey methods, respondents may be shown limited stimulus -- eg an advert, a leaflet cover or a website design. Face to face interviews also enable researchers to target respondents more easily by demographic, geographic and socio-economic group.

### Telephone interviews

Structured interviews that are conducted over the phone by a trained moderator. Telephone and face interviews are the most costly methodology and they are normally conducted by a third party agency.

## Weaknesses and when not to use

Although surveys can be a quick and cheap manner in which to conduct user research, they often:

* don’t allow much time or context for considered replies
* leave room for questions to be misinterpreted
* have a completion bias -- one common criticism is that they are only completed by people who are either very satisfied or very dissatisfied

## Participants

All surveys, regardless of methodology, should use a robust sample that is nationally representative or representative of an audience of interest. Most nationally representative surveys are 1,000 people or more, but can be significantly larger if there are a number of distinct user groups that are being targeted.

It is important that the delivery channel used considers the target audience. For example in the recent Digital Landscape research an online and face-to-face methodology was used as both online and offline audiences needed to be interviewed -- an online only methodology would have excluded those who are offline, and the opinions of this audience omitted from the research.

It is also important to note that performing research with hard-to-reach groups can be more time consuming and costly (eg black and minority ethnic, people with disabilities).
