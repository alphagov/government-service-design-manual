{:.intro}
A summary page lets users check and edit the answers they've given before submitting a form.

<div class="example">
  <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/design-patterns/summary-page.png" alt="An example of a summary page">
</div>

The two main benefits of summary pages are:

* **increased completion rates** - users are reassured that the correct data has been captured so are less likely
to drop out of the transaction before completing it
* **reduced error rates** - users are given a second chance to spot and correct errors before submitting the data

---

## Signpost summary pages clearly

Make it very clear from the page title that the transaction isn't complete and the user still has to submit the form.
Otherwise users may think they've finished and abandon the transaction early.

The submit button on these pages must very clearly describe the action, 
eg ‘Change your tax details’ or ‘Send your claim form’. 
Don’t just use ‘Submit’ or ‘Confirm’.

## Design with security in mind

Because these pages play back information entered by your users they must be designed very carefully.
In some cases you might need to obfuscate parts of the data to reduce the risk that it's read by the wrong people.

Each service is different. Work with your security team to make sure that there's an acceptable level of risk.
