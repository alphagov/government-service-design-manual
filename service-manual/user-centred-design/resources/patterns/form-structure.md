{:.intro}
Choose a structure for your forms that most naturally fits the way people need to use them.

## 1. Asking questions

You can use a question or statement format. 
For example ‘What is your date of birth?’ or ‘Date of birth’.
Just remember to be consistent across the transaction.

Guidance:

* use questions or statements, but be consistent
* ask for as little information as you can
* keep the questions short and straightforward 
* explain why you're asking a question if it's not obvious

---

## 2. Structuring forms

Ask yourself:

* how many questions are there?
* will users need to answer the questions in a fixed order?
* will they need to complete the transaction in a single session?
* will their answers affect other parts of the transaction?
* will certain answers result in the user having to abandon the transaction?
* will they need to add or remove items from a list, or change the order of items?
* how many parties are involved in the transaction?
* do any parts of the transaction take place offline?
* at what point is the transaction regarded as complete?

---

## 3. Example structures

Thinking about the above will help you decide on an appropriate structure.
Here are some of the more common approaches:

### 1. Single page of questions

All questions are placed on a single page.

**The good:**

* there's only one submit button to press
* a single URL gives access to all form fields
* it doesn't force a fixed order of completion
* you benefit from context of neighbouring sections
* progress is self-evident

**The bad:**

* long forms can be overwhelming and off-putting
* it's less well suited to branching or non-linear flow
* how do you save partial progress?
* can be harder to track analytics like drop-off rates
* making validation errors usable is harder

---

### 2. One question per page

Each question goes on its own page.

![Diagram showing each section on it's own page](/service-manual/assets/images/designing-transactions/wizard.png)

**The good:**

* it's easier to handle branching and dependencies between questions
* it's easier to let the user save progress
* a transaction can feel more manageable
* easier to guide a user through an unfamiliar process
* easier to capture analytics like drop-off rates for each section

**The bad:**

* harder to show progress
* uers have to click more to progress through the questions
* you lose the context of neighbouring questions
* you need to build a seperate page to review and edit questions
* doesn't naturally handle non-linear processes like looping, adding and removing

---

### 3. Accordion form

All questions on a single page, but each new question only appears once the previous section has been completed.

![Diagram showing an accordion form](/service-manual/assets/images/designing-transactions/accordion-3.png)

**The good:**

* can handle branching and dependencies between sections
* users can review and edit previous questions at any time
* can help guide a user through an unfamiliar process
* user still benefits from some surrounding context
* progress is clear

**The bad:**

* Implementation and interface is more complex

Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options.
Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make. For example:

* Will future questions be shown in any way or will you only see the questions you've answered?
* What happens if you go back and edit a previous question?
    * Does the current question stay open or closed?
    * How do you get back to the current question once you've edited a previous one?
    * Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit?

### 4. Hybrid

For more complicated transactions, some combination of the other options might be your best bet.

Again, done well this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help people to understand when they have moved into a different part of the transaction, and break up the monotony of filling in forms.

As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.
