The end page of any transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain.

These pages should let the user know:

* that they have successfully completed the transaction
* their reference number if there is one
* what further actions they need to perform, and when
* what further actions they can expect from the service, and when
* who they should contact with any queries or complaints
* about any related information and services
