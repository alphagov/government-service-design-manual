All digital services that government provides must end (and start) on
GOV.UK.

GOV.UK done pages:

+ are the very final step after a user has finished interacting with the transaction
+ help frame the service
+ capture satisfaction and comments
+ allow measurement of KPIs for the performance dashboard

Contact the mainstream business as usual content team via the [GOV.UK Support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/new_feature_request/new) to ask for
a done page when you ask for your [start
page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/start-pages).
You should do this close to your beta launch.
