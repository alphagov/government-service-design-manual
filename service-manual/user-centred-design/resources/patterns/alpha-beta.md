{:.intro}
This guide explains when and how to use the GOV.UK alpha and beta banners.

##When to use the alpha and beta banner

You have to use an alpha banner if your thing is in alpha, and a beta banner if itâ€™s in beta.

###Things on the service.gov.uk subdomain

If your service is in beta or alpha, you must show the relevant banner in the header. It should sit directly underneath the black GOV.UK header and colour bar, as in this example:

<div class="example">
  <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/alpha-beta/betabanner.png" alt="Beta banner">
</div>

###Things on GOV.UK

If your GOV.UK content is in beta or alpha, show the relevant banner below the page title, but above the body content. You can see what they should look like in [this blog post](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/26/betas-on-gov-uk/).

##Get the banner code

All the code and assets you need to implement the alpha and beta banners are available via the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/tree/e295f45f59495f8e37e37a105da6d9d8b2695a54#-phase-banner).
