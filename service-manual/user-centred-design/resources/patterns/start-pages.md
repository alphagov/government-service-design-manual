{:.intro}

All digital services that government provides must start (and end) on
GOV.UK. A start page is one way that this may happen.

Start pages are written by the mainstream business as usual (BAU) content
team at GDS. The start page and the content in your service should
complement each other.

Contact the team the [GOV.UK Support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/new_feature_request/new) to ask for a start page when you're close to
your beta launch. You should include:

+ what the service is and who it's for
+ what user needs it addresses
+ eligibility criteria and restrictions
+ what documents or information the user will need to use the service
+ a preview of the service (if available)
+ other methods of applying eg phone and post
+ a demo URL (with a username and password if necessary)
+ when the service is expected to pass its beta assessment

Factor in time it'll take for the content to be written and fact-checked -
the start page can only be published after both:

+ the service passes its [beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html) or self-certification
+ the service goes live
