{:.intro}
All digital services that government provides need a start page. This is the single point of entry for the service that tells the user what they can expect once they click ‘Start’. 


The service should not be accessible through search engines, nor should the URL be shared publicly.

You need to be thinking about what will go on the start page from the [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html) stage. You will need to have a functioning start page, hosted by GOV.UK, ready for the [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html) stage. 

[Contact us](https://www.gov.uk/contact/govuk) using the content requests route once you’ve passed your alpha assessment (or self-certification).

The start page and the content in your service should complement each other. Take a look at our [blog post](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2013/11/14/start-page-discovery/) to see our thinking when creating a start page. The [renew a tax disc](https://www.gov.uk/tax-disc) start page is a great example of how a start page should look.

When you contact us, we need to know:

* what the service is and who it’s for
* what user needs it addresses
* eligibility criteria and restrictions
* what documents or information the user will need to use the service
* a preview of the service (if available)
* other methods of applying eg phone or post

All start pages should meet the following goals:

## 1. Describe the service

Include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible ('Renew your passport', Claim for disability allowance', 'Book a driving test' etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service.

Use the [GOV.UK SEO guidance](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/seo) for headings, introductions and metadata descriptions.


## 2. Set expectations

People will base their expectations on their experiences of other digital services, like online shopping and banking.
If your service doesn't match these expectations then you should let your users know as early as possible.

In particular, people need to know up front about:

* financial costs
* long waiting periods or delays
* obscure information they'll need to provide
* complex eligibility requirements
* equipment they'll need (eg. a printer)
* non-digital parts of the transaction

Use common sense. Don't try to force everyone to read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won't).

The best approach is to meet or exceed people's expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you won't need to warn everyone about those things up front.


## 3. Establish eligibility

If your eligibility requirements are relatively simple, write them on the start page.

If they're more complex you should consider offering an eligibility checker, eg a short 'smart answer'.
It's better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you're doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they're not eligible to use it.

Things that don’t work very well:

* long bullet lists of eligibility criteria on the start page
* links to ‘see guidance notes’ within a service that send users to long-winded documents
* when it’s not clear what’s the eligibility checker and what’s the actual application 
* eligibility checkers asking the same questions that will be asked in the service later on as users find this very frustrating
