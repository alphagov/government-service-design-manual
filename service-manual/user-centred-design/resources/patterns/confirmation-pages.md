The confirmation page should be the last page of the transaction.

These pages should let the user know:

* that they have successfully completed the transaction
* their reference number if there is one
* what further actions they need to perform, and when
* what further actions they can expect from the service, and when
* who they should contact with any queries or complaints
* about any related information and services

A ‘Finished’ button at the bottom of the page should link to the [done page](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/done-pages) for the service.
