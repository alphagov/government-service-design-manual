Card sorting is a research method used to understand the way that the intended users of a website naturally organise or think about different types of information or content. It's also a method service teams can use to sort and arrange [user needs](/service-manual/user-centered-design/user-needs.html).

## How to carry out a card sort

The method is very simple to use: it involves simply writing the needs or topics on pieces of card (maximum of around 50) and asking representative users to organise these into groups, which are then given a meaningful label.

15 to 30 users are recommended: a minimum of 15 users will give reasonable confidence in the results, but any more than 30 gives diminishing returns.

### Closed sorting

It is also possible to conduct a closed card sort, whereby the users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories.

## Where/how you might use it

Open card sorts are most suitable for identifying how users think about information, in order to build an information architecture. Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture.

##Weaknesses/when not to use

The analysis of card sorting can be difficult if no clear categories emerge. It can also be difficult to conduct a card sort on a very large website with a broad scope of content (eg GOV.UK) since the maximum number of cards may not be representative of all of the content.

## Online tools

Card sorts can also be conducted using an online tool such as [OptimalSort](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm). This is a cheap and effective way of reaching a large sample of users without needing to bring them into a dedicated lab facility for the study.
