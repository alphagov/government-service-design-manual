The [service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-13) states that your service should be built “with the same look, feel and tone as GOV.UK”.

The first place to start is by reading our [design principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples). These will help you to understand how we approach design. You should keep these in mind when designing and building your service, always thinking about how to make the service simpler, clearer and faster.

## Is your service on GOV.UK?

By “on GOV.UK” we mean the service is either at `www.gov.uk/myservice`, `myservice.service.gov.uk` or `myblog.blog.gov.uk`. At the point of launch it should look like GOV.UK and should have the GOV.UK logotype, including the crown.

If your service isn’t on GOV.UK you can still follow the guidance, but your site shouldn’t identify as being part of GOV.UK and should not use the crown or the GOV.UK logotype in the header. Here is a good example of [a site that follows our design patterns](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/18/intranets-dcms/) without using the logo.

## Is it live?

### Alpha

At alpha stage, the important thing is to make something and make it quickly, before testing it with real users. You should follow the design principles and should spend your time working on the user journey, interface and experience, but you don’t need to worry about making everything pixel perfect in your prototype.

### Beta

At beta the main priority is creating a simpler, clearer, faster service. You should concentrate on making the user journey and experience as simple and clear as possible. However, you should  be moving towards a finalised look and feel, how fast you achieve this depends on the size of your design team and how much time you can dedicate to it.

### Live

Before your service goes live it must look and feel like GOV.UK.  You should be using the correct typography, header and footer and if necessary should have followed the guidance on pictures and icons.

Throughout the process of creating your service you should refer to the design principles, think of the user and design for simplicity. The user experience across all services on GOV.UK should be consitent.

## Typography

Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information.

If your service is on GOV.UK you will be given access to the New Transport typeface.

[Read our full guidance on typography](/service-manual/user-centered-design/resources/typography).

## Pictures and icons

In most cases your service will not need to use pictures.

You should only use icons if they are clear, simple and help to convey information more clearly than text alone could.

## Header and footer

If your service is on GOV.UK you should use the standard template for your header and footer.
