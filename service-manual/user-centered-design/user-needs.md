Deep understanding of your users' needs is crucial for building a successful digital service.

## Defining user needs

Any thinking about a service, whether online or offline, must start with the question: What is the user need?

Defining a user need must be strict and honest. For GDS, it’s the need the *user* has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user.

That's an important distinction, because it means that you'll be able to more measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who will make use of them.

## Work out your proposition

## You can't do it all at once

You need to set the boundaries of what your service can and should offer, to prevent a bottomless list of user needs.

This is especially true of a government website such as [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/). As well as identifying user needs, we identified which of those needs the government must answer. This led to the ‘It’s in if...’ criteria:

- it’s something that only the government does
- there is clear demand for it from users (ie. through search and traffic logs) or the government is legally obliged to provide it
- it’s something that people can do or it’s something people need to know before they can do something that’s regulated by/related to the government
- it’s something the government provides, does or pays for
- it’s inherent to a person’s or an organisation’s rights and obligations
- it’s straightforward advice that helps people to comply with their statutory obligations (eg what records you should keep for your HMRC tax return) or provides certain kinds of advice and support to businesses, but excludes general life or business advice that is provided by third parties

Similar criteria may help you determine which needs you build a service to meet.

## User stories
Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

1. Define the user need
2. Write the user story from the perspective of the user
3. Define the acceptance criteria
4. Solution is explored and delivered by the service team
