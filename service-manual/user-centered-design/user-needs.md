Deep understanding of your users' needs is crucial for building a successful digital service.

## Defining user needs

Any thinking about a service, whether online or offline, must start with the question: what is the user need?

Defining a user need must be strict and honest. For GDS, it’s the need the user has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user.

That's an important distinction, because it means that you'll be able to more measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who'll make use of them.

## How we define user needs

### Gather the evidence

You should be able to provide evidence that a user need actually exists, and starting from the potential evidence areas can be a good way to start creating a list of user needs.

Good evidence points can include:

- Existing content. Use web analytics to show that content that already exists is being regularly accessed
- Search terms. Use search logs to show that people are expressing a need for content or functionality by searching for it on the website
- Customer facing staff. Talk to people who work on service desks or in call centres. These people talk to users regularly and are able to tell you what the most pressing and real user needs are.
- User research. You may have previously commissioned user research that can help you understand what your users needs are. You can also commission from your research team a quick user research study that will help you understand and validate user needs by talking directly to a sample of users.

### Frame the need correctly

The way you describe each user need can have a big impact on how successfully you ultimately meet the real need of the user. Especially for your most important user needs it's important to make sure you have framed the need correctly – that is, described it using words that actually reflect what the user's trying to do and aren't just loosely describing the kind of content you think they might need.

For example, when thinking about tax codes, consider the solution you might design for this user need: 'as a user I want information about how tax codes are calculated'. Now consider the solution you might design for this user need: 'as a user I want to know if I'm on the right tax code'. 

It can be difficult to get the framing right from analytics data alone. Especially for your most important user needs, be sure to do some qualitative research (talking directly to users) and talk to frontline staff to make sure the wording properly reflects the real user need.

## Work out your proposition

### You can't do it all at once

You need to set the boundaries of what your service can and should offer to prevent a bottomless list of user needs.

This is especially true of a government website like [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/). As well as identifying user needs, we identified which of those needs the government must answer. This led to the ‘It’s in if...’ criteria:

* it’s something that only the government does
* there's clear demand for it from users (ie through search and traffic logs) or the government is legally obliged to provide it
* it’s something that people can do or it’s something people need to know before they can do something that’s regulated by/related to the government
* it’s something the government provides, does or pays for
* it’s inherent to a person’s or an organisation’s rights and obligations
* it’s straightforward advice that helps people to comply with their statutory obligations (eg what records you should keep for your HMRC tax return) or provides certain kinds of advice and support to businesses, but excludes general life or business advice that is provided by third parties

Similar criteria may help you determine which needs you build a service to meet.

## User stories
Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

1. Define the user need
2. Write the user story from the perspective of the user
3. Define the acceptance criteria
4. Solution is explored and delivered by the service team
