##How to write

This section gives details on naming your service, tone, style, questions and why we write in this way.

Our document [how users read](/service-manual/user-centered-design/how-users-read.html) tells you more about user reading behaviour, which will help when designing the content for your service.

##Guidance

All services should follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).
The way we talk to users is the same on all [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) products. The only difference is the format.

###Introductions
Services should be intuitive and government services should provide an exceptional user experience. You shouldn’t need many words at the top of the page and none of it should be instructions on how to use the service. If you need to manage a user's expectations, tell them on the pre-transaction page, not on the service page.

If you do have to add text, keep your sentences very specific, short, active (keeping the subject and verb close) and in plain English. Users won’t want to read much on a tool or transaction. They will want to click, answer questions and get to the end as quickly as possible. It’s unlikely they will read much at all, so only tell them what you need to.

###Service titles
Don’t use terms like ‘my benefits’ etc. This will mean different things to different users. Some will think it is a list of all the benefits they've had, some will think it is an online account to manage benefits and others won’t know what to think. Don’t use puns or clever terms. Keep the service title clear, short and specific.

###Page titles
Keep page titles specific to the questions on the page. If the page is just about the user’s address, call it ‘your address’. Don’t call it ‘about you’ unless you're covering a number of different elements of ‘about you’ on the page.

###Questions
Make sure you need any question you include in your service. Don’t include questions that you think you might need later or for another part of your organisation. Keep the transaction as specific as possible to the task the user is trying to complete.

##Tone and style

###Don’t use jargon
Jargon is used differently by different people, so you'll be opening up the language to misinterpretation.

###Spin
We lose trust if we use spin or try to ‘convince’ a user of something. Give them the facts they need and don’t try to encourage. The facts should speak for themselves - if the information is clear enough, the user will make their own decision.

###Subheads
You use fewer eye muscles to look down than you do across. That might be why users prefer to scan down a page and not across.

By providing clear, specific subheads you are helping the user to scan the page and find the information they are looking for.

In tools and transactions, it’s unlikely you'll have a lot of information to break up, but if you do, use subheads.

##Guaranteed success
The only way you'll know if your service works is to test it with users. Then modify it and test it again.


##Why we do this
[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) opens up government information and services to anyone who's interested or needs to interact with government.

###Inclusive
As government we need to be inclusive - we can do this through our design and language. By making the design open and easy to read, the code clean and accessible and the words easy to understand, we're opening up government to all.

###Responsibility
Citizens of the UK can’t go to anyone else for many of our services. 

If we make the information hard to read or the design so distracting or difficult that the user doesn’t understand what we're trying to say, they could end up doing it incorrectly or not doing it at all. This could lead to a fine. Or in very extreme cases, jail.

Good design and words isn’t a desire or an ‘aim’ - it's our responsibility.

# Writing terms and conditions
The terms and conditions of your service must be understandable to the majority of users.

##Guidance

[GOV.UK's terms and conditions](https://www.gov.uk/support/terms-conditions) were written to conform both the legal terms defined by the [Treasury Solicitors Department](http://www.tsol.gov.uk/) (TSol) and to the [style guide of GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).

These form a template for other services to use, and cover many of the conditions that operational services published as part of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) will require.

If your service needs additional terms or conditions added to this list then these should be written clearly, in a way that most users will be able to understand. This means unpicking lots of the legal language and giving users concrete examples to help them understand what a specific term or condition means.

Adding that term or condition should be done in consultation with GDS.

##Why we do this
Directgov proved to be a good model for this, as their terms and conditions were clearly written and easy to understand. [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) continued this, with additional pieces of information added as transactions and services were incorporated into the site.
