## Government IT Strategy

Formally the [Government IT Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85968/uk-government-government-ict-strategy_0.pdf)
says the following about open source.

> Where appropriate, government will procure open source solutions.
When used in conjunction with compulsory open standards, open source
presents significant opportunities for the design and delivery of
interoperable solutions.

As part of that strategy Government committed to producing an [Open
Source Procurement Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-procurement-toolkit).

## A level playing field

Government has a _level playing field_ between proprietary
and open source software. This is formalised in the [Technology code of
practice](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/code-of-practice.html).

> Ensure a level-playing field for open source software. Demonstrate
an active and fair consideration of using open source software --
taking account of the total lifetime cost of ownership of the
solution, including exit and transition costs.

## Understanding risks

CESG, the National Technical Authority maintain a series of good practice
guides for information assurance, including Good Practice Guide (GPG) 38 -
Open Source Software - Exploring the Risk. Broadly this concludes the quality
of the software is the primary driver for security, rather than the license
model. Closed or open source code is not more or less secure in the
majority of cases due to licensing alone.

The licensing model doesn't really have an impact on how you use
software. You need to consider the same things as part of selecting
technology:

* characteristics of the software
* support models
* level of maturity
* future direction

Open Source has a vibrant commercial ecosystem, and lots of companies
provide support or work on proprietary and open source software. What
varies is generally how you buy something (licenses vs pure support),
what that means for internal skills and ultimately your rights to modify
the software for your needs.

In reality it's very likely you've used open source software at some
level of the stack already. Whether that's the Linux operating system
or the Java programming language, or it might be ASP.NET MVC or
NHibernate on a Microsoft platform.
