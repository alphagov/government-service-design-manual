Considerations for using open standards and why they matter.

> Please note, this is for guidance purposes only, and should not be taken as [legal advice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANACL).

## Open standards overview

We define open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, as those which demonstrate all of these criteria:

*Collaboration* - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties.

*Transparency* - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process.

*Due process* - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality.

*Fair access* - the standard is published, thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost.

*Market support* - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions, the standard is mature, supported by the market and demonstrates platform, application and vendor independence.

*Rights* - rights are essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty-free basis that is compatible with both [open source](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions.

## Building on open standards

There are 7 open standards principles that you should follow when thinking about which open standards to use:

1. We place the needs of our users at the heart of our standards choices.
2. Our selected open standards will enable suppliers to compete on a level playing field.
3. Our standards choices support flexibility and change.
4. We adopt open standards that support sustainable cost.
5. Our decisions on standards selection are well informed.
6. We select open standards using fair and transparent processes.
7. We are fair and transparent in the specification and implementation of open standards.

We describe the reasons for these principles and their implications in the [Open Standards Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles), published in November 2012.

## Choosing which open standards to use

The Open Standards Board will be selecting some compulsory open standards using the [Standards Hub](http://standards.data.gov.uk/) process.

Where these standards have been identified you should use them.

If you are looking for an open standard and we’ve not set a compulsory one in that space, you should carry out a thorough assessment of the existing standards and choose a standard that meets your needs and is consistent with our definition.

You should also consider how the standard fits with:

* user and functional needs
* security and legal requirements
* economic efficiency of government as a whole
* interoperability
* preventing lock-in

If you are considering use of a standard that doesn’t meet our definition of an open standard, you’ll need to apply for an exemption.

You’ll also need to apply for an exemption if you want to use an alternative standard to one that performs the same function if we’ve already selected compulsory standards for that purpose.

## Why we do this

By implementing open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, we are:

* improving our flexibility and the ability for government to provide services based on users’ needs and avoid digital exclusion based on the technology choices we make
* putting in place a level playing field for open source and proprietary software, giving us the ability to move between different technologies without the risk of lock-in
* making it easier to share appropriate data across and beyond government boundaries to provide efficient services for users and for our delivery partners
* making the cost of our digital services more sustainable by reducing complexity and encouraging reuse

## Guidance

Build component-based digital services, based on open standards, to provide a flexible design to give you greater choice and enable your digital services to evolve.

Expressing your user needs in terms of required capabilities, which are in turn based on open standards, helps you to make better choices for service delivery. It also means that there is no unintentional lock-in built into government digital services.

Whether designing and building in-house or outsourcing, you must require solutions that comply with open standards, for software interoperability, data and document formats, where they exist and meet functional needs.

If there's a reason why you think using open standards is inappropriate, then
an exemption may be agreed in advance on an exceptional case-by-case basis.
Any exemption would be agreed with the government’s Chief Technology Officer
(or through Departmental Accounting Officer procedures for cases below the Cabinet Office’s
[spend controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1)
threshold for IT).
