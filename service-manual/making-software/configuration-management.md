Your system is likely to be much larger than a single application, relying on other supporting infrastructure components. Even a simple application probably requires some configuration, to provide database credentials or a web service endpoint for instance. 

In order to build robust, scalable and portable systems this configuration data should be well managed.

## Management tools

Configuration management tools help with documenting and maintaining the configuration and dependencies of a software system. Although this could be done using hand-made software, it's common to use existing tools.

Three examples of existing open source configuration management tools are [CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/), [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) and [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/).

### Infrastructure as code

One approach to managing configuration is to describe the configuration and the software dependencies in code. This brings with it all the advantages of programming in general, including:

* testability
* reusability
* executable documentation
* common and constrained language to describe a problem domain

Once described in code the infrastructure configuration is executed against the servers, networks and software in question.

### Build for portability

Moving software systems between providers can be difficult and time-consuming. Even with compatible providers and simpler procurement rules it's possible to build lock-in with simple technical inertia. 

Configuration management encourages a deep understanding of the configuration of the system and this can be used to move software easily between providers.

### Use the same tools for development and production

A common problem in software systems is seen when code written by a development team works on their machine or a test environment but not on the production environment. A common cause of this is differences in configuration â€“ different versions of software, different types of database or application server. This can be avoided by using the same tools for both development and production environments.

## Why we do this

Existing approaches to managing configuration are often manual, process heavy, slow and error prone. Ultimately people are bad at carrying out detailed monotonous tasks. And installing and configuring software across tens or hundreds of servers (if done by hand) is definitely monotonous.

Even if this could be done to provide everything correctly configured on day 0, over time configuration drifts if not kept in check. One traditional approach to this problem is to make configuration changes hard, thereby limiting the number of them. When trying to build agile and flexible software systems rapid change is needed and manual processes break down.
