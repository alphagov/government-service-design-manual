We use automated testing to ensure that our code does what is intended, to
protect against misuse of that code, and to provide assurance that iterating
that code for better design or new features doesn't break existing behaviour.

Automated testing is an important part of our overall approach to [quality](/service-manual/agile/quality) but only one part of it.

## Approaches

There are various approaches to writing automated tests. In particular there are differences in when people expect to write tests, and in the ways that they're expressed.

Many practitioners insisting that automated tests should always be written before the code they seek to test (to ensure careful design and 'just enough' code) while others are happier writing tests after the fact. Tests that are written before the code offer a number of advantages and that approach should be encouraged, but the most important thing is that the whole team works to ensure there are automated tests, that those tests are understood as an asset of the product and that they help you ensure the quality of your code.

It is common to talk about behaviour-driven development (BDD) as an alternative approach to test-driven development. BDD is an approach to automated testing that focusses on expressing tests in the "[ubiquitous language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html)" that the whole team should share when discussing problems. There are various tools that have been created to facilitate BDD but it is an approach that can be implemented using most traditional tools.

## Types of testing

Any code written for your service should have a suite of tests operating at two levels:

### Acceptance testing

Requires broad tests that run through high-level functionality end-to-end,
making sure that the pieces of the system come together to provide the right
service.

A developer should be able to describe the steps in any acceptance test to the product/service manager in a way that makes sense to them and matches how they expect the service to be used (or abused!)

### Unit testing

Focussed on the specific details of the code ensuring that each discrete unit of code does what is expected of it. They allow the developers to verify that complex calculations are performed correctly, to ensure that code handles bad input properly, and that optimisations to the code don't break its behaviour.

## When to write tests

We aim to write a first set of tests at the start of working on a feature. An acceptance test that describes the end-to-end behaviour ensures that everyone involved understands the objective of a piece of work, and can demonstrate progress through the story at hand. Unit tests can then be written to understand the implementation of the code.

Tests are often described as 'happy path' or 'sad path'. Happy path tests verify that the system can be used as intended, while sad-path tests verify that it handles errors (whether bad input from a user, a vital API being unavailable, or some other issue) gracefully. We start with happy path tests and a few simple sad path tests and then add more sad path tests as our understanding of the code and its dependencies develops.

Tests should also be written whenever a bug is discovered. A test to reproduce the bug should be written before it is fixed, allowing you to verify that the bug has been fixed and ensure that it isn't reintroduced later.

## Test early and often

Developers are expected to run tests regularly, especially before sharing new code, they are verified as part of the code review process, and they are also run regularly in a shared continuous integration system to ensure the whole team has a chance to see how they're performing.
