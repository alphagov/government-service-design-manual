## Microcopy

Microcopy is the short words or phrases used during transactions, 
for things like buttons, form labels, help text, alerts and questions.

### Guidance

* Use sentence case
* Address the user directly
* Follow the style guide
* Don't use 'please' on labels - but give polite, clear, short instructions
* Don't use colons after labels
* Don't add 'your' to labels, for example: 'Your name', 'Your address', unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: 'your name', 'partner name'

### Asking for personal details

* 'First name' not 'Christian name'
* 'Middle names'
* 'Last name' not 'Family name'
* 'Age'
* 'Date of birth' (not 'DOB')

### Help text

Your service should be easy enough to use with a minimum of help text.
Stick to design conventions where they help users understand what they need to do.

Provide explanatory text or examples immediately above or below the field 
if it helps users understand what they need to do.

Edge cases can be dealt with using progressive disclosure.

Some transactions require that the user have a certain amount of knowledge of a subject matter. 



#### On-page help
One line under the label that will help the user to fill in that field.
Examples: &lsquo;If you don't have your form XYZ rsquo; or &lsquo;Where to find your Unique Tax Reference Number.&rsquo;

#### Show/hide
Use an expandable show/hide box for slightly more lengthy instructions. You can use statements and questions but don't use the first person.
Examples: &lsquo;If you want to apply for both of these benefits&rsquo; (in this instance, you can&rsquo;t and there is another process you have to go through.

#### Light box
Only use a light box for help if you are explaining a concept or part of a process - don't use it for explaining any part of the service. If you need to explain how the service works with that much text, your design is probably wrong.


###Radio buttons

Use: Yes [button] No [button] (note caps)

Keep to the same convention (yes first) on the page.

    
## Start and end of transaction pages

### What counts as a 'transaction'?

Transactional services are those that enable exchanges of information, money, rights or goods between two or more individuals. For GOV.UK this is typically between the government and the user of the service.

Simple exchanges of information, where no personal information about the user is stored by government, are not classed as transactions. For example, GOV.UK content formats like guides and smart answers are not classed as transactions.


### Transaction start pages

The start point for any GOV.UK transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. Users should not be able to jump to a later page in the service via some other means (e.g. Google).

The design of the start page will be determined by the nature of the service and it's audience. All start pages should meet the following goals:

#### Describe the service

The page should include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible ('Renew your passport', Claim for disability allowance', 'Book a driving test' etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service.

#### Set expectations

People will tend to base their expectations of what a transaction involves on their experience of other digital transactions, for example, online shopping and banking.

If your service has features that do not match these expectations then you should inform your users of this as early on as possible, ideally on the start screen.

Users should be told about any financial costs or long waiting periods involved. If they'll be asked to provide relatively obscure information let them know so they can get it ready.

If there are specific eligibility requirements for the service let people know. If the eligibility requirements are complex you should consider using the Smart Answer format to help people understand whether or not they are eligible.

It's better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you're doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they're not eligible to use it.

### Transaction end pages

The end point of any transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. These pages should:

1) Let the user know that they have successfully completed the transaction
2) If further actions are required, let the users know what they are
3) If no further actions are required, point users in the direction of other relevant information and services
