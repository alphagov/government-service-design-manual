When we refer to agile, we are referring to a culture of:

* iterative development
* responding to change
* collaboration and completing, releasing and iterating work as set out in the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org)

When taking part in any training, it’s important to remember that there are many different approaches to applying this manifesto and its principles. These are only interpretations and there is no one way of doing it. At GDS, we are framework- and methodology-agnostic. We take the tools that we need to from a range of techniques and use the most appropriate for the project and team to help support them to deliver. This means that not all teams will be working in exactly the same way.

# Intended audience

These are the four categories of people that might want to learn more about agile, the content in the more detailed sections below is repeated where it is relevant to multiple categories of people:

[Agile delivery practitioner (and those wanting to be)](#agile-delivery-practitioner)

These people need to use agile every day and help teach others. Typical roles are:

* delivery managers / scrummasters / agile project managers
* agile programme managers
* product managers
* service managers

[Delivery team members: if you are becoming part of a delivery team](#delivery-team-members)

This covers any other people who’ll be part of an agile team, eg:

* developer
* user researcher
* designer
* tester etc

[People who govern and stakeholders: if you are going to be a member of a governance team or a stakeholder for an agile project](#people-who-govern-and-stakeholders)

These people are senior responsible officers (SROs), project leads, directors and those responsible for supporting an agile project. Typical roles are:

* SRO, director
* HR, business operations
* marketing
* commercials
* policy teams
* legal teams

[Interested others: if you are just interested in finding out more](#interested-others)

This covers anyone that has an interest in understanding what it means to work in an agile way.

# Options for learning

Formal training is only one part of learning, as with most new skills. With agile delivery management in particular, training will only give you the foundations of some of the techniques, but the real learning comes from doing. It’s important that the organisational culture is set up to support learning and experimenting.

## Agile delivery practitioner

Think about ways to start getting hands on experience as quickly as possible.
This can come through:

* shadowing / learning from others
* formal training
* self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs)
* sharing ideas and support (community, blogging, public speaking)
* small experiments and running short projects
* questioning and retrospecting (short feedback loops and [retrospectives](/service-manual/agile/running-retrospectives))

**Shadowing / learning from others**

You can learn a lot from seeing others who are practicing agile techniques.

Because teams are open and transparent, they should be happy to invite you into planning, review and retrospective sessions. You should also try to spend some time shadowing or working with delivery practitioners on problems to give you a better understanding of how they apply agile.

Try to invite external speakers in to share their own experiences with you and your department and take the chance to discuss your ideas with them.

**Formal training**

Training courses are useful to help understand theory, but it’s important to remember that there is no one answer to how to run every project and that training does not equal learning.

It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing.

Some options to think about when training are:

* specific frameworks and methodologies: Start with lightweight frameworks and methodologies such as [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/), Kanban and Extreme Programming ([others are available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_methods))
* more specific practices such as: agile user stories, agile estimating, agile planning, managing teams ([more are available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_practices))
* softer skills such as workshop facilitation, coaching, motivating teams

**Self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs)**

You can teach yourself through self-initiated learning, networking and reading books and blogs.  The first thing you should read is [the agile section of the Service Design Manual](/service-manual/agile).

Networking is a useful way of learning. You can also find local meetups and events close to you at [www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) or you could start your own.

There are hundreds of blogs about agile and lean techniques with lots to learn. Subscribe to ones that you think are interesting. GDS also has an [agile delivery community](http://linkydink.io/groups/gds-agile-delivery-community) links list that’s updated regularly, which you can subscribe to. It’s also worth having a look to see if there are any relevant collections on the links collection service [paper.li](http://paper.li/newsstand) as well as other web collections of links.

**Sharing ideas and support (community, blogging, public speaking)**

Once you’re confident, teaching others is a good way to learn. Try engaging in communities like those on LinkedIn, blogging on your own and others’ blogs about agile or speaking about your experiences internally, at meetups or events.

**Small experiments and running short projects**

The best learning can come from doing. Agile techniques can be applied to many types of projects and are not restricted to software. This means that you can quickly start to learn as a team through running small projects.

Take a project that you’re working on and start to apply agile techniques to it, then improve on them as you go. You can learn a lot from being unsuccessful: the phrase “fail fast” is often used in an agile context, but what you can benefit from is learning quickly.

**Questioning and retrospecting**

You’ll learn a lot through asking questions and there is an agile tool that helps you to do this -- the [retrospective](/service-manual/agile/running-retrospectives). This is an important part of any agile team and a good way of learning -- everyone has an input. Regular retrospectives are great way to understand what works and what doesn’t, so you can think about how your learning can be directed.

## Delivery team members

* pairing / learning from others
* formal training
* self-initiated learning (reading books and blogs)
* sharing ideas and support (community, blogging, public speaking)

**Pairing / Learning from others**

Pairing comes from the term pair programming in Extreme programming, but is just as relevant to different types of work. During this practice two people will sit together to work on the same thing at the same time.

One of you is writing the code or doing the task, and the other is observing and giving input. The benefits of working in this way lead to better quality of code, better communication amongst the team and learning how something is built and why decisions were made. Pairing will rapidly increase learning as an individual and as a team.

**Formal training**

Training courses are useful to help understand theory, but it’s important to remember that there is no one answer to how to run every project and that training does not equal learning.

It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing.

* specific frameworks and methodologies: Start with lightweight frameworks and methodologies such as [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/), Kanban and Extreme Programming ([others are available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_methods))
* more specific practices such as: agile user stories, agile estimating, agile planning ([more are available here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_practices))

## People who govern and stakeholders

Think about how you can enable teams to perform to the best of their abilities. This can come through:

* understanding and applying the GDS governance principles
* formal training
* learning from others
* self-initiated learning (reading books and blogs)
* questioning and retrospecting

**Understanding the GDS governance principles**

GDS have provided some [principles for governance on an agile project](https://digitaltransformation.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/24/governance-principles/):

- don’t slow down delivery
- decisions when they’re needed, at the right level
- do it with the right people
- go see for yourself
- only do it if it adds value
- trust and verify

It’s important that you understand the detail behind these principles so they can help create the right culture and support for agile projects (and learning) to flourish.

**Formal training**

As someone who needs to support delivery and have a broader understanding of agile, you should look for courses that give you an introduction to agile and its benefits, understanding user research, agile estimation and planning.

You can use the [Civil Service Learning](https://civilservicelearning.civilservice.gov.uk) portal to book formal classroom training as a civil servant.

**Learning from others**

Try to invite external speakers in to share their own experiences and talk to them about how they compare to yours.

See how other people are doing agile within your organisation. Part of the [delivery manager](/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager) / scrum master role is that of a coach and they can help you understand the benefits of working in an agile way.

There’s also a [job description for an agile coach](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions#non-scs-specialist-roles) in the service design manual if you need to bring someone in.

**Self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs)**

You can teach yourself through self-initiated learning, networking and reading books and blogs.  The first thing you should read is [the agile section of the Service Design Manual](/service-manual/agile).

Networking is a useful way of learning. You can also find local meetups and events close to you at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) or you could start your own.
