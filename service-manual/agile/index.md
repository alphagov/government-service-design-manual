Agile methodologies will help you and your team to build world-class, user-centred services quickly and affordably. 

This way of working can be very different for those used to long specifications and procurement processes, but itâ€™s essential for producing high-quality services to a standard that many users expect.

## What is an agile project?

An agile project is about creating fast iterations of products based on the feedback of real users. 

It means regularly releasing small pieces of functionality; constant communication between team members, and using equipment that displays progress being made by your team (eg project management software or whiteboards).

## User stories

User understanding is the most important factor when creating a service, so you need to have a clear understanding of what users need and make sure those needs are met. You can achieve this by writing user stories. 

A user story is generally one or more sentences in length and describes: 

* who the user is
* what they need from the service
* why they need it

These user stories will help your team to produce the required features of your service, and writing them well can make a huge difference to the quality and speed of development.

## Main features of agile

Product development during an agile project is broken into different stages, called sprints. 

In a sprint, team members aim to achieve goals within set timeframes. A sprint at GDS generally lasts a week and runs from Wednesday to Tuesday, however other agile development teams may run longer or shorter sprints.

Have daily team meetings (stand-ups). Stand-ups are an opportunity for members of your team to discuss: 

* the previous day's work
* what they plan to work on
* any blockers to their progress

## Retrospectives

Run retrospectives at the end of each sprint.  A retrospective should cover:

* what went well
* what went badly
* how to improve the working environment or process for the next sprint

Retrospectives can also increase in scope to cover full projects or project phases.
