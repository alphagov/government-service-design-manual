This guidance aims to help service managers develop good assisted digital support. It will also help you to prepare for the service assessment as it lists questions and prompts that can be raised in assessments.
This guidance is given in tandem with the definitions and parameters laid out in [Assisted digital - information for service managers](/service-manual/assisted-digital).

##During service design phases
There are [4 service design phases](/service-manual/phases): discovery, alpha, beta and live.

An assessment will take place:

* at the end of alpha
* before testing your service in a live environment (sometimes called public beta)
* before going fully live on GOV.UK (or an alternative domain for departments who are exempt from GOV.UK)

We’ve put together [this checklist](/service-manual/assets/documents/assisted-digital-information-template.pdf) to help you keep track of information you’ll need as you develop your assisted digital support.

##Discovery: starting to understand user needs

During this phase you must develop a high-level understanding of assisted digital user needs, user numbers and what assisted digital support for your service might look like. You should develop a plan to answer these questions:

* what are your early estimates of how many of your users will require assisted digital support? 
* what are the demographic characteristics of your assisted digital users?
* what might the assisted digital user journeys and personas look like for your service?
* what is your plan for developing your understanding of assisted digital user needs and support requirements during the alpha phase?

For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research). 

##Providing evidence that your service doesn’t need assisted digital support
Some services may not have to provide assisted digital support, as explained in the section on [assisted digital information for service managers](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research). You’ll need to carry out research and gain evidence of this to explain it in the alpha review.

##Alpha: designing assisted digital support

In alpha, your objective is to learn the needs of your assisted digital users and then design assisted digital support that meets those needs. You then test this model during the beta.

You'll need to show evidence of meeting your key performance indicators (KPIs) before going live, so plan on how to measure your service.

During the alpha stage, you should carry out research to gain understanding of your assisted digital users’ current abilities, confidence and barriers to completing your service independently. For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##The alpha review (assessment)
This review takes place before the service can move to beta, and may cover the following questions and prompts:

**1. What user research have you conducted with assisted digital users and what have you learnt that will inform the design of your assisted digital support?**

As the service manager, you must be able to:

* explain what types of research, when, with how many people, including recruitment specification
* explain how the assisted digital support might be tailored according to research carried out so far
* explain why, if relevant, your service does not have to provide assisted digital in line with GDS policy, and what alternative will be in place for any assisted digital users

**2. What are your plans to test, measure and iterate your assisted digital support during beta?**

You must be able to explain how you will test, measure and iterate your assisted digital support during beta. Your testing must be with assisted digital users going through the end-to-end user journey. This includes identity assurance.

**3. Will your assisted digital support be sustainably funded and free to the user?**

You must be able to explain how you plan to ensure assisted digital support is sustainably funded (including support not delivered by government) and free to the user.


##Assisted digital support during identity assurance

During alpha, you need to plan on how you’ll make sure that assisted digital support is in place for the entire user journey. This includes times when the user has to visit a third party site for identity assurance, such as [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify).

Think about how this could affect or overlap with other central government transactions during their identity assurance. For example, talk to service managers of [exemplar services] in your department and other service managers in the service manager community to discuss what they are doing in this area.

##Assisted digital support must be sustainably provided

You must make sure that sustainable assisted digital support is in place for all users who need it and that no one is excluded from using the service on the basis of cost.

You need to make sure that assisted digital support is sustainably funded,
including support provided by friends, family, and support not funded by the
department, eg:

* a different government department
* a non-government funding body
* charitable donations
* the citizen

##Beta: testing and measuring your service
In beta, you need to thoroughly test your end-to-end assisted digital support. This will help you to gain accurate metrics and measurements.
The beta phase has 2 distinct stages:

* beta while testing in a closed environment to a limited user group
* beta where the service is on the GOV.UK domain (this is sometimes called public beta)

When your digital service is in public beta, you must test your support on the entire scope of your service’s assisted digital users.
Learn more about [how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##The beta assessment

The beta assessment will decide whether a service is ready to move to public beta.
To meet the Digital By Default Service Standard requirements to move to beta on the GOV.UK domain, the service manager must be able to talk about and evidence how they have built on their work and evidence from the discovery, alpha and private beta phases.
A beta assessment may cover the following questions and prompts:

**1. What user research have you conducted with assisted digital users during the beta, and what have you learnt?** 

You must be able to explain:

* the types of research carried out, when and with how many people
* the recruitment specification, including users of your service at the lowest end of the digital inclusion scale 
* findings from any tools you used as recommended in the assisted digital guidance in the service manual (eg personas, digital inclusion scale)
* how you have iterated your support following analysis of research and user feedback

**2. How many transactions and what costs are you expecting when live for your assisted digital support?** 

You must be able to give details for each relevant channel (eg web chat, telephone, face by face on the high street and face by face as outreach/home visit) and by provider (including non-department), including:

* costs per minute
* number of transactions per year
* sustainable funding

**3. How will the assisted digital support you are putting in place meet user needs?**

Explain how the following elements of the service’s assisted digital support are designed to meet user needs:

*  channels and providers
* user journeys (including identity assurance and needs assessment)
* consistency with similar government transactions
* approach to digital inclusion

**4. How will you test your assisted digital support and use feedback to iterate your assisted digital support during the beta?**

You must be able to explain the thinking and decisions behind plans for testing your assisted digital support, including how you will:

* gather user insights, including recruitment specification
* use these insights to iterate your assisted digital support

##Transaction costs by channel
You need to show an understanding of the cost of providing assisted digital support for your service. You can do this by working out the cost per minute of providing each support channel. This makes it possible to compare costs across channels. 

Costs should include and exclude specifics as listed in the page on [measuring cost per transaction](/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction#costs-to-include). You should also exclude free or sub market-value support (eg given by volunteers), as it's not sustainable.

##Support across government services

Your research into your users’ needs should also tell you what other government services they are using. Consider how their use of those services might connect with your service. You should then make sure that the user journey is consistent and joined up, where relevant and possible.

##Approach to digital inclusion

You must give your users training or guidance to help them complete transactions on their own in the future.

This may include:
* making it easy for assisted digital users to find digital skills training opportunities
* running assisted digital support in such a way as to build the user’s skills and/or confidence (eg allow the user to see the screen during in-person support or reassure and encourage them to try completing the service themselves)

For more information on digital inclusion, read the [Government Digital Inclusion Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy).

##Live phase

Your assisted digital support meets your users’ needs, but this is not the end of the process. You need to continuously improve your assisted digital support based on [analytics](/service-manual/operations/monitoring), [user feedback](/service-manual/operations/helpdesk), and [user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

You’ll repeat the development phases (discovery, alpha, beta and live) for smaller pieces of work, as the service continues to run. You’ll find something that needs improvement, research solutions and make iterations.


##The live assessment
This takes place during the beta phase and ensures the service is ready to go fully live on a GOV.UK domain. To meet the requirements for live, you must be able to show how you have built upon each phase - from discovery to alpha to the beta phases.

A live assessment may cover the following questions and prompts:

**1. How did you test and iterate your assisted digital support in beta, in response to user research and performance measurement?**

You must be able to:

  * explain how you tested and iterated your assisted digital support during beta, including identity assurance
  * explain how you measured performance and what the results were, including user satisfaction and confidence that the assisted digital support provider was trustworthy
  * give examples of positive feedback from users and experts

**2. Can you explain how the assisted digital support you are putting in place meets user needs?**

You must be able to explain how the design of the following elements of each channel of the service’s assisted digital support are meeting user needs:

* channels and providers
* user awareness
* user journeys (including identity assurance and needs assessment)
* availability and wait times for support
* availability of appropriate technology
* approach to users’ privacy
* consistency with similar government transactions
* approach to digital inclusion
* ability to forecast and respond to changing demand

**3. How many transactions are you expecting and how much does your assisted digital support cost?**

You must be able to:

* show that costs per minute are in line with estimates, per channel
* give details of expected number of transactions per year, per channel

**4. How will you measure the performance of your assisted digital support in live, including user satisfaction and a decrease in the number of assisted digital users?**

You must be able to explain how you will measure the performance of your assisted digital support, including user satisfaction and decrease in the number of assisted digital users.

**5. How will you iterate your assisted digital support in response to user testing and feedback when the service is live?**

You must be able to explain your plans to iterate your assisted digital support once the service has gone live.

##Visible support
Your user testing must show that users who need assisted digital support are aware of it and can access it easily.

You should point users towards a needs assessment to check their eligibility for assisted digital support. This maximises digital take-up by making sure that assisted digital support is only given to users who really need it.

Basic information about assisted digital support should be visible and clear to the user. It should also be shown in places where they already go for support, including through existing communication channels and on the service’s GOV.UK start page.

Assisted digital support should promote the digital service and not be marketed or promoted. This means that digital take-up will be encouraged.


##Easily accessible support
You must be able to show, from user research, that your service’s assisted digital support is easy for users to access, at appropriate times and places.

This could mean having phone line or in person support available in the evening, and that users report acceptable wait times for an appointment or for their call to be answered.

For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##Measuring the performance of support
You should be able to measure the performance of your assisted digital support. This should include measuring support provided by third party suppliers, and payment by results where relevant.

Measurements should include user satisfaction and a decrease in the number of assisted digital users. You should incentivise suppliers to improve both of these measurements, where relevant.

This enables you to demonstrate on your Performance Platform dashboard that your service’s assisted digital support is working effectively, and to look out for signs of where improvements could be made.
