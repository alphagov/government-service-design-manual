##How to develop assisted digital support

Some new digital services will have a greater assisted digital requirement than others. However, all new digital services will need to demonstrate that appropriate plans have been put into place for those users who will need assistance in order to meet the Digital by [Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).


##Discovery: understanding your assisted digital users and their needs.

By the end of the discovery stage of your digital transformation, you should have developed a plan to answer these  questions:

1. How many of your users do you estimate will require assisted digital support?
2. What is your early thinking around the needs of users who may require assisted digital support?
3. What offline provision is currently available for your service and is it provided in-house or externally?

Your understanding of the number of users who may require support and what their needs are will be at a very early stage and have a number of gaps. As you build your service you'll be able to fill these gaps and iterate your initial answers.

##Building your digital service
A good starting point is to consider how many users use current online digital services which your department currently offers to understand how many users opt for offline channels. Information about the digital take-up of some services is available on the [Transaction Explorer](https://www.gov.uk/performance/transactions-explorer).

It's also useful to understand the demographic make-up of your users to learn why people need assisted digital support. You could improve your insight by also using the ['Digital Landscape Research'](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/), which provides a cross-population view of who's online and who's offline.

Once you have an idea as who your assisted digital users are, you can start early work concentrating on what these users may need. Look at how existing support for your service helps users make the transaction. Support is already available if:

* some of your users go to intermediaries or proxy users to access your digital service
* your department works with organisations who help people develop digital skills
* the provision of your service involves other organisations who provide support to assisted digital users

This support may be formally put in place by your department, happening informally, or is part of the other organisations’ work, for example:

* there might be intermediary groups, like lawyers, who are involved in the service provision
* if your service has a high proportion of older users, charities may be helping those users access services

To help you move into alpha, you can start work with these intermediaries and organisations to understand the needs of potential assisted digital users. Even at this early stage, think about the reasons why users may need some form of assisted digital support. 

Do you think that your assisted digital users:

* lack digital skills?
* lack access to the internet?
* lack confidence in doing digital transactions with government?
* a combination of the above.


##Alpha: developing preferred options for assisted digital provision.

By the end of the alpha stage of your digital transformation, you will need to be able to answer these questions:

1. What are the [needs of users](/service-manual/user-centered-design/user-needs.html) who may require assisted digital support, based upon evidence based research? 
2. What might the assisted digital user journey look like? Is there a preference for:
  *face-to-face support with someone doing the transaction alongside them
  *telephone support
  *intermediaries they’re already in contact with about the service
  *another form of support 
3. What research have you conducted/feedback have you received on your user journey from users and/or experts?
4. What are your prefered options for assisted digital support? Why?

For your digital transformation project to meet [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index.html) and be allowed to proceed to beta, you must be able to answer these questions to a reasonable level of detail, and demonstrate your thinking behind them.

###Assisited digital user research
[Exemplar departments](https://www.gov.uk/transformation) have conducted [user research](/service-manual/user-centered-design/introduction-to-user-research) with users of current offline channels to better understand the needs of potential assisted digital users. Departments researched:

* why these users accessed offline channels
* what their intention would be if the offline channel was removed in favour of an assisted digital option
* based on their needs, what elements would need to be included in assisted digital provision for them to use a digital service

This research has enabled departments to confirm initial thinking as to whether their users lack digital skills, lack access to the internet or lack confidence in doing digital transactions. It could even be that users fall into more than 1 of these categories.

If someone has internet access and skills, but prefers not to use the digital service, then they are targets for [channel shift](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html), not assisted digital.

As a part of [agile methodology](/service-manual/agile), develop [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) based upon these user needs.

Use the user stories to visualise what the assisted digital user journey will look like. Draw it out step by step, using a series of post-it notes to plot the user journey. Every time a user interacts digitally in the transaction, consider the support that an assisted digital user would need. 

GDS regularly meet a panel of user experts and have published information on work already carried out with these groups on the [GDS blog](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/assisted-digital/). GDS can introduce you to these organisations.

People you should involve at this stage are:

* your existing users who'll need assisted digital support in the future
* people in your organisation who work with assisted digital users
* organisations who support people offline to access services
* organisations who are already providing formal and informal support to your users

At this point, [exemplar departments](https://www.gov.uk/transformation) have found it useful to formalise thinking on assisted digital by creating an assisted digital strategy or plan. Any such plan should be able to answer, in reasonable detail, the questions above which allow a digital service to pass [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index.html).

As per the ['Government Approach to Assisted Digital'](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/), support should be sourced from the private and voluntary sector as the default. GDS, departments and the Government Procurement Service have begun market engagement to set up a shared procurement route for commissioning assisted digital services. 

However, if you'd like to provide assisted digital support in-house, you need to let us know at this stage and make sure that you can provide a strong, value for money case.

##Beta: public testing.

By the end of the beta stage of your digital transformation, you'll need to be able to answer these questions:

1. What have you done to pilot your proposed assisted digital support?
2. What can be done to iterate the support, based on what you have learnt? 

To meet [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index.html), your digital transformation project will be allowed to go live only after you've piloted your assisted digital support.

###Testing your assisted digital support

You should build on your formal assisted digital plan where you have outlined options for assisted digital. Do this by running user-centred research to test these options with assisted digital users who will use your service.

If you've developed more than 1 option for what this support may look like, you could operate your pilot to cover all of these options and find, through user testing, which best supports the needs of users. Alternatively, you might prefer to narrow down your options before you pilot, based upon what you already know about your users' needs, and concentrate on 1 or 2 of your most viable options.

Your pilot of assisted digital services may be on a small scale. However, it's vital that your plans are tested on real assisted digital users at this stage before your service goes live.

You should involve experts and intermediaries in creating your pilot. GDS can support this by introducing you to organisations we work with.

You should test the whole of your assisted digital user journey, looking at each point where the user interacts digitally in the transaction and testing the planned support at that point.

While testing, ask users if they were:

* able to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, ask:
  * what the user thought of the journey
  * what went well
* unable to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, find out:
  *what stopped the user from completing the transaction

Use this information to iterate the assisted digital support and continue to ask for feedback from users, providers and experts to make sure the support is suited to user needs throughout the beta and live phases.
