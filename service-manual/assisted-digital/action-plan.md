The assisted digital action plan will help you to:
 
* understand the needs of your assisted digital users
* develop assisted digital support that meets their needs

The plan currently has more detailed information on the discovery and alpha stages of a project. This is because most of the services being redesigned are currently in those stages, and is where the steps are most similar across services.
 
The plan will be updated as more services move through the redesign process.

##Discovery: understand your users and their needs

###1. Understand how many of your users will need assisted digital support

The first step is to understand how many of your users:

* have the digital skills to use the new digital service independently
* will need assisted digital support
 
Right now this will be an estimated figure.

You might be able to identity this from existing user insight, or you may need to commission more research to fill this gap. Use the GDS ‘[Digital Landscape Research](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/)’ alongside your own understanding of your users, as it provides a cross-population view of who is online and who is offline.

###2. Understand more about your users and their needs
 
Once you’ve identified your assisted digital users, start to gather more information about them. Again, this might be information you already have or new information you need to gather.

Concentrate getting information on:

* the basics of these users  
* who they are (eg socioeconomic group, age)
* where they are located (eg are they in locations where getting access to the internet is difficult)
* why they need assisted digital support:
    * do they lack digital skills?
    * do they lack access to the internet?
    * do they lack confidence in doing digital transactions with government?
* what kind of support would work for them, such as:
    * face-to-face support with someone doing the transaction alongside them
    * telephone support
    * intermediaries they’re already in contact with about the service

If someone has internet access and skills, but prefers not to use the digital service, then they are targets for [channel shift](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html), not assisted digital.
 
As part of your research, think about ways support for your service is already available. You can learn from this and make it part of the assisted digital support for your service. Support is already available if:

* some of your users go to intermediaries or proxy users to access your digital service
* your department works with organisations who help people develop digital skills
* the delivery of your service involves other organisations who provide support to assisted digital users
 
This support may be formally put in place by your department, happening informally, or is part of the other organisations’ work, eg:
 
* there might be intermediary groups, like lawyers, who are involved in the service delivery process
* if your service has a high proportion of older users, charities may be helping those users access services
 
At this stage, your understanding of user needs and existing support will be high level and have gaps, but you can fill these gaps as you progress through the service build.

##Alpha: develop options for assisted digital support

###3. Develop assisted digital user stories
 
Now that you’ve completed steps 1 and 2, it’s time to develop a series of user stories for your assisted digital users:

* eg “I’m a claimant who has never used the internet - I need access to the internet and help to use the service, so I can make an application”
* eg “I’m a claimant who has access to the internet, but I usually just send emails and watch videos, so I need some help to use the digital service”
 
Read guidance on [writing user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) for more information on how to do this.

###4. Develop your vision of an assisted digital user journey

Think about using your service from start to finish - what do you think a user journey will look like? Concentrate on developing multiple user journeys.
 
A simple way to do this is to visualise the process by drawing it out step by step, using a series of sticky notes to plot out the user journey. Each time a user interacts digitally in the transaction, consider the support that an assisted digital user would need.
 
Use each of the user profiles / stories you’ve developed and think about how their needs could be met.

###5. Open up your work to users and experts

Involve users and experts already supporting people who are offline to access services. You’ll have identified these people and what they do in the discovery phase. Involving them will help you to come up with better options for assisted digital support.
 
You can do this at any stage of the process – and the more you do it, the better - but at the very least involve them at the stage.
 
People you could involve are:

* your existing users who will need assisted digital support in the future
* people in your organisation who work with assisted digital users
* organisations who support people offline to access services
* organisations who are already providing formal/informal support to your users

GDS can introduce you to such organisations and have published information on work already carried out with these groups on the [GDS blog](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/). Contact the assisted digital team at GDS for more details.
  
###6. Narrow it down to preferred options for assisted digital support
 
Consolidate your ideas and options into a list of preferred options for assisted digital support, bringing together:

* the ideas you generated in sections 4 and 5
* your understanding of the size of your assisted digital user group
* your understanding of what the digital service might look like

This will also help with forming your requirements for procuring this support from the private and voluntary sectors.
 
Completing these steps means you’ll leave the alpha stage with:

* an increased understanding of your users and their needs
* options for your assisted digital support to test during the beta phase
 
GDS, departments, and the Government Procurement Service have begun market engagement to set up a shared procurement route for commissioning assisted digital services. If you are not already involved in this work, please contact the assisted digital team at GDS.
 
##Beta: public testing

###7. Prepare and pilot assisted digital support alongside your digital service

Develop a pilot of your proposed assisted digital option or options, and test it alongside the digital service with real assisted digital users.

At a minimum, ask users if they were:

* able to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, ask:
    * what the user thought of the journey
    * what went well
* unable to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, find out:
    * what stopped the user from completing the transaction
    * what else is needed to help them complete the transaction

###8. Review the pilot

Review the results of your beta test. Again, open up this review to users, experts and intermediaries. Act upon any lessons learnt from testing.

##Live

###9. Plan, commission and implement assisted digital services
 
Plan and commission assisted digital services from private and voluntary sector providers, based on your findings from the beta test.
 
Work closely with colleagues developing plans for increasing digital take-up and phasing out existing alternative channels (eg paper channels) - criteria 11 and 24 of the Service Standard.

Combined with your work on assisted digital, these will come together to help:

* encourage everyone who can use digital services independently to do so
* target assisted digital support at the people who really need it
* close non-digital channels as demand decreases
 
##Support models
GDS are developing shared models of assisted digital support to make sure consistency exists across all services. Once these models are in place, all services must follow them. Contact the GDS assisted digital team for more details.

###10. Review assisted digital provision regularly
 
After 3-6 months, review your assisted digital support with your users, providers and external experts.

Continue to ask users for their feedback, so you know that your support is still meeting their needs. If it isn’t meeting their needs, adjust your support according to the feedback.
