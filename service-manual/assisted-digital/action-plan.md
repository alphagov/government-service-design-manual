All new digital services must demonstrate appropriate [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research), and show that suitable support is in place to meet their needs, to meet the [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).

The information in this document will help you to:

* meet the Service Standard at each development phase
* understand your assisted digital user volumes and needs
* develop assisted digital support that meets user needs and provides good value for money

You may find it useful to complete [this form](/service-manual/assets/documents/assisted-digital-information-template.pdf) (PDF, 106KB) as you develop your assisted digital support in line with the Service Standard. You can also tailor the [form](/service-manual/assets/documents/assisted-digital-template.docx) for your own service.

## Discovery: understanding your assisted digital users and their needs

The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of assisted digital user needs and what your assisted digital support will look like. GDS’s guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research) will support you in developing your service throughout all stages.

Do some work to understand the demographic makeup (eg gender, age, disability status, region) of who needs your assisted digital support. [The Digital Landscape Research](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/) provides a cross-population view of who is offline in the UK. You should also look at current users of offline channels for your department's services.

Once you have an initial understanding of who your assisted digital users are, start to understand their needs. Work with people already supporting your users to complete digital transactions. They might be staff in your department, organisations who help people develop digital skills, or intermediaries such as charities, lawyers, libraries, Citizens Advice Bureau, JobCentre Plus, or other commercial agents.

GDS regularly meet a panel of user experts and have published information on work carried out with these groups on the [GDS blog](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/assisted-digital/).

Existing assisted digital support may be informal and uncoordinated. Think about how you will make sure there’s formal, funded and sustainable assisted digital support for all users who need it. This support should cover all relevant channels, such as web chat, telephone, face by face (on the high street or in the user’s location).

You should start to develop [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories) and personas based on assisted digital user needs. These will help you visualise specific needs and user journeys.

By the end of the discovery phase, you should have developed a plan to answer these questions:

1. How many of your users do you estimate will require assisted digital support and what is the proportion of total users?
1. What are the demographic characteristics of your assisted digital users?
1. What are your existing support channels for assisted digital users and how are you likely to provide support in future? This should be in line with GDS assisted digital guidance and the [Government Approach to Assisted Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-approach-to-assisted-digital).
1. What do initial assisted digital user journeys and personas look like for your service?
1. What is your plan for developing your understanding of assisted digital user needs and provision during the alpha phase?

Your understanding of the number of users who may need support and their specific needs will be at an early stage and may have some gaps. As you design your service in alpha, you’ll be able to fill these gaps and iterate your initial answers.

## Alpha: designing assisted digital provision

The objective of the alpha phase is to design a support model with which to test the appropriateness of your support and your understanding of user needs.

At this point, you should formalise your thinking on assisted digital and create an assisted digital plan. This will state how you will provide assisted digital to the standards set out in the [GDS assisted digital guidance](/service-manual/assisted-digital).
The guidance includes key performance indicators (KPIs) for your assisted digital support, so you will need to include ways to measure your service.

During the alpha stage, you should understand your assisted digital users’ current ability, confidence and barriers to completing your service independently. You need to find out if they lack:

* confidence with using computers and the internet
* experience
* access to an online device
* trust in sharing personal information online
* full physical or cognitive ability

You’ll need to continue [developing user personas and user journeys](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research) based on assisted digital user needs. You should involve:

* your existing users who’ll need assisted digital support in the future
* people in your organisation who work with assisted digital users
* organisations who support people offline to access services
* organisations who are already providing formal and informal support to your users

You’ll need to put suitable plans in place to support your assisted digital users if your service requires [Identity Assurance](/service-manual/identity-assurance).

You should also consider any impacts on or overlaps with other central government transactions, to make sure that the user journey is consistent and joined up across services, where relevant.

Assisted digital support should follow shared models which are currently being developed and tested by [GDS and exemplar services](/service-manual/assisted-digital). By the end of the alpha stage, you’ll need to be able to answer these 7 questions to be allowed to proceed to beta:

1. How many of your users do you estimate will require assisted digital support and what is the proportion of total users?
1. What barriers do your assisted digital users need to overcome (eg skills, access, confidence, motivation) to use the digital service independently?
1. What is your plan to test your assisted digital support before the digital service moves to GOV.UK? Your tests should be in line with GDS guidance and the [Government Approach to Assisted Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-approach-to-assisted-digital). The results should help you develop your assisted digital support so that it’s ready to be fully tested during beta.
1. What are the user journeys for your service’s assisted digital user personas (including ID Assurance if required)? Include estimated volumes for relevant channels:
  * web chat
  * telephone support
  * face by face support on the high street
  * face by face support at home (outreach)

1. What research have you conducted and what feedback have you received on your user journeys from users and/or experts?
1. How will you fund your assisted digital support so that it’s sustainable, and is the support free to use for the user?
1. How will you gather user insights and use them to iterate your assisted digital support in beta?

## Beta: testing and measuring your service

During the beta phase, you will fully test and complete end-to-end assisted digital support so you have accurate metrics and measurements in place.

### Beta: before GOV.UK

You should continue to do user research and sufficiently test your assisted digital support with users in the early stage of beta. You should involve experts and intermediaries in your testing. GDS can support this by introducing you to organisations we work with. You should test the whole of your assisted digital user journey, looking at each point where the user interacts digitally in the transaction and testing the planned support at that point.

Before your digital service moves onto GOV.UK, you’ll need to demonstrate:

1. The specific [needs of users](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research) who may require assisted digital support (including accessibility). This must be established by evidence-based research.
1. Your plan to fully test assisted digital support in beta. This should include:
  * timelines
  * details of how assisted digital support will be provided, by channel
  * forecast volume, during testing and when live -- this should also be split by channel
  * forecast costs in live, by channel
  * showing assisted digital support that is joined up and consistent with relevant central government transactions
  * showing how [digital inclusion](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-strategy-action-15) will be incorporated into your support
  * evidence that all assisted digital support meets legal requirements, including language requirements, Data Protection Act, accessibility etc
1. How you’ll gather user insights in beta (in testing and/or pilots) and use them to iterate your assisted digital support for live.

### Beta: on GOV.UK

When your digital service is in [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html#the-objective-of-a-beta) and on GOV.UK, it’s vital that your plans are fully tested on real assisted digital users before your service proceeds to the live stage.

Testing should cover all channels that are relevant for your assisted digital users and should be in line with [GDS assisted digital guidance](/service-manual/assisted-digital). You should establish ways to get ongoing feedback from users about your assisted digital support and to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs). This will help you to provide evidence that your service will meet user needs, is high quality and provides good value for money.

Use this information to iterate the assisted digital support and continue to ask for feedback from users, providers and experts. This will make sure the support is suited to user needs throughout the beta and live phases. You should share your findings with GDS and other service managers.
By the end of the beta stage, you’ll need to be able to answer these questions to proceed to live:

1. What have you done to test your assisted digital support?
1. What evidence do you have that your assisted digital support meets users’ needs and provides good value for money? Show that:
  * volumes and costs for different channels are in line with estimates
  * users are aware of assisted digital support and can access it easily
  * your assisted digital support is consistently and clearly branded as a government service
  * wait times are low for all support channels
  * a high volume of users successfully complete the transaction
  * the volume of assisted digital users has decreased
  * the service is trusted
  * feedback from users and experts is positive, with good end-to-end user experience
  * your users have a joined-up and consistent assisted digital support across central government transactions
  * all assisted digital support meets relevant legal requirements, including language requirements, Data Protection Act, accessibility
1. What will you do to iterate your assisted digital support in live, based on what you have learnt from your testing?
1. What is your plan for ongoing evaluation and iteration of assisted digital support? Include how you will measure performance for the following:
  * user satisfaction
  * increase in users’ digital skills and/or confidence to use digital services unaided
  * decrease in the volume of people using assisted digital support

Your digital transformation project must meet the [Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index) before it goes live. Your project can go live only after you’ve thoroughly tested your assisted digital support and can prove that it meets user needs and provides good value for money.

## Live: continuous development

This is not the end of the process. The service should now be improved continuously, based on user feedback, KPIs and further user research.

You should have plans in place to provide training or guidance for your assisted digital users so that many are able to complete transactions independently in future, through [digital inclusion](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-strategy-action-15). You may also need to [close down services](/service-manual/phases/retirement) if your former offline channels are being replaced.

You should be able to show your service’s assisted digital information on your Performance Platform dashboard.
