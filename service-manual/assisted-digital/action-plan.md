Find out [what assisted digital support is](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital), and whether you need to include it in your service design.

This guidance aims to help your service team develop good assisted digital support. It will also help you to prepare for service assessments as it lists questions and prompts that you may have to discuss in assessments.

You must consider assisted digital support when making sure your service meets [the 18 points of the Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default).

##During the service design phases
There are [4 service design phases](/service-manual/phases): discovery, alpha, beta and live.

Assessments should take place:

* at the end of alpha
* before your service moves into a live environment for testing (sometimes called public beta)
* before your service goes fully live

##Discovery: starting to understand user needs

During this phase you must develop a high-level understanding of assisted digital user needs, user numbers and what assisted digital support for your service might look like. You should develop a plan to answer these questions:

* what are your early estimates of how many of your users will require assisted digital support?
* what are the demographic characteristics of your assisted digital users?
* what might the personas and user journeys look like for your service's assisted digital users?
* what is your plan for developing your understanding of assisted digital user needs and support requirements during the alpha phase?

For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##Providing evidence that your service doesn’t need assisted digital support
Some services may not have to provide assisted digital support, as explained in the section on [Assisted digital support - policy information for service teams](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital). You’ll need to carry out research and gain evidence of this to explain it in the alpha review.


##Alpha: designing assisted digital support

In alpha, your objective is to learn the needs of your assisted digital users and start to design a model of support that meets those needs. You then test this model during the beta.

You'll need to show evidence of meeting your key performance indicators (KPIs) before going live, so start planning how to measure your service.

During the alpha stage, you should carry out research to gain understanding of your assisted digital users’ current abilities, confidence and barriers to completing your service independently.

You should remember the following key points when carrying out research into your users’ assisted digital support needs:

* carry out research with users of this specific service
* include potential users (not just current users)
* include users with the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access
* include users who are receiving (or would seek) support from third parties (like friends and family, charities, trade bodies and companies)
* use appropriate recruitment and research methods to reach these users

For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS guidance on [assisted digital user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##Assisted digital support during identity assurance

During alpha, you need to plan how you’ll make sure that assisted digital support is in place for the entire user journey. This includes times when the user has to visit a third party site for identity assurance, such as [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify).

Think about how this could affect or overlap with other central government transactions during their identity assurance. For example, talk to service teams of [exemplar services](https://www.gov.uk/transformation) in your department and service managers in the service manager community to discuss what they are doing in this area.

During alpha, you need to consider how your assisted digital support will help the user complete the whole transaction. If your service asks users to prove their identity using GOV.UK Verify, you will need to make sure that GOV.UK Verify is included in the scope of your assisted digital support. [Read more about providing assisted digital support during GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital#providing-assisted-digital-support-during-govuk-verify).

##Make sure assisted digital support is sustainably provided
You must make sure that sustainable assisted digital support is in place for all users who need it and that no one is excluded from using the service on the basis of cost.

You need to make sure that assisted digital support is sustainable, including support that isn’t funded by the department, for example support funded by:

* a different government department
* a non-government funding body
* charitable donations
* the citizen

##The alpha review (assessment)
This review takes place before the service can move to beta. You’ll be asked questions about the following topics:

* your user research and the user needs you’ve found
* your user research and usability testing plans
* your service team
* whether your assisted digital support is free and sustainable
* how you designed your service’s assisted digital support elements
* how you analyse your service’s performance and KPIs

###Your user research and the user needs you’ve found
You’ll need to discuss:

* the research you have you done to understand users’ assisted digital support needs
* how you’re making sure that the users you research meet the following conditions:
  * they use (or would use) your specific service
  * they include people who use the service now and people who may use it in the future
  * they include people with the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access
  * they include people who will seek assisted digital support from third parties (like friends and family, colleagues, companies, charities or trade bodies)
* how your recruitment and research methods are appropriate for reaching users most likely to need assisted digital support
* the user needs you’ve identified for users who need assisted digital support
* the stories, personas, profiles or other ways you're describing users who will need assisted digital

###Your user research and usability testing plans
You’ll need to discuss:

* how you’ve dedicated members of your team to do ongoing user research into your users’ assisted digital support needs and how you’ll pay for this
* how you’re using what you’ve learned from research and support testing to change the way you develop the assisted digital support elements of your service

###Your service team
You’ll need to discuss:

* whether someone in your team is assisted digital lead for the service, responsible for including assisted digital support
* whether your assisted digital lead has the time and the skills to design, build, operate and continuously improve the service’s assisted digital support model, including all routes (eg phone, face to face, web chat) and all providers

###Free and sustainable assisted digital support
You’ll need to discuss:

* how you’ll make sure that all assisted digital support for your service, including routes provided by third parties, are free to the user
* how you’ll make sure they’re sustainably provided and not likely to close in the near future

###How you're designing the support elements of your service
You’ll need to discuss:

* how users of your service currently meet their assisted digital support needs
* the support you’re considering for your assisted digital support model, the providers you intend to use, and why
* the design challenges for your service’s support model

###Analysing performance data and KPIs of your assisted digital support
You’ll need to discuss:

* the person in your team that’s responsible for identifying data insights that you can use to improve your assisted digital support
* how you’re measuring the performance of the existing service’s assisted digital support

##Beta: testing and measuring your service
In beta, you need to thoroughly test your end-to-end assisted digital support. This will help you to gain accurate metrics and measurements.

The beta phase has 2 distinct stages:

* beta while testing in a closed environment to a limited user group (this is sometimes called private beta)
* beta where the service is on the GOV.UK domain (this is sometimes called public beta)

When your digital service is in public beta, you must test your support on the entire scope of your service’s assisted digital users.

Learn more about [how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##Check the other government services users are using
Your research into your users’ needs should also tell you what other government services they’re using.

You should:

* consider how their use of those services might connect with your service
* make sure that the user journey is consistent and joined up, where relevant and possible.

##Digital inclusion
You must give your users training or guidance to help them complete transactions on their own in the future.

This may include:

* making it easy for assisted digital users to find digital skills training
* running assisted digital support in way that builds the user’s skills and confidence (eg allow the user to see the screen during in-person support or encourage them to try completing the service themselves)

For more information on digital inclusion, read [the Government Digital Inclusion Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy).

##The beta assessment

Your service must pass a beta assessment before it can move to beta on the GOV.UK domain.

To pass the beta assessment, you must explain how you’ve built on your work and evidence from the discovery, alpha and private beta phases.

As a service manager, you’ll have to answer questions on the following topics:

* your user research and the user needs you’ve found
* your service team
* your design for the assisted digital support elements of your service
* how you’re planning to test the assisted digital support for your service

###Your user research and the user needs you’ve found
You need to explain how your team’s research into user needs continues to meet the requirements you discussed in the alpha assessment.

You’ll also need to show:

* you have the resources to do regular user research with users who need assisted digital support
* how often you’ll do this research

###Your service team
You’ll need to discuss:

* are you, as service manager, the single responsible person with the power and knowledge to make decisions to improve the assisted digital support elements of the service on a day-to-day basis during beta?
* can you give an example of how you were empowered to make decisions on assisted digital support during alpha?

###How you’re testing the assisted digital support for your service
You’ll need to discuss:

* whether the resources in place to do regular usability testing of all assisted digital support, from all providers
* how you’ll test the end-to-end user journey for your assisted digital support (all routes from all providers), including identity assurance segments like Verify and how often you’re currently doing this
* how you’re checking that all of the assisted digital support (all routes from all providers) will be able to handle the number of support requests you expect

###Your design for the assisted digital support elements of your service
You’ll need to discuss:

* the design options you’re considering for your assisted digital support
* how the team is designing the service’s assisted digital support (all routes from all providers) to meet user needs
* how you’re using what you’ve learned from user research and testing and what you’ve learned to influence the design of your service’s assisted digital support model
* the end-to-end user journeys for assisted digital support - you’ll be asked to explain these including identity assurance, if required
* why you’ve decided not to provide any particular routes of assisted digital support, for example telephone or face by face, talk through or on-behalf-of
* whether you can continuously improve all of your service’s assisted digital support (all routes from all providers), for the full end-to-end user journey
* the design challenges for your service with assisted digital users

###Analysing performance data and KPIs of your assisted digital support
You’ll need to discuss:

* the person in the team who’s responsible for identifying data insights during the beta that can be used to continuously improve the assisted digital support
* how you’re measuring the performance of all of your assisted digital support (existing and beta) for your service
* how you’ll analyse the performance of the assisted digital support for your service in future


##Live phase

Your assisted digital support meets your users’ needs, but this is not the end of the process. You need to continuously improve your assisted digital support based on [analytics](/service-manual/operations/monitoring), [user feedback](/service-manual/operations/helpdesk), and [user research](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

You’ll repeat the development phases (discovery, alpha, beta and live) for smaller pieces of work, as the service continues to run. You’ll find something that needs improvement, research solutions and make iterations.

##Visible support
Your user testing must show that users who need assisted digital support are aware of it and can access it easily.

You should point users towards a needs assessment to check their eligibility for assisted digital support. This maximises digital take-up by making sure that assisted digital support is only given to users who really need it.

Basic information about assisted digital support should be visible and clear to the user. It should also be shown in places where they already go for support, including through existing communication channels and on the service’s GOV.UK start page.

Assisted digital support should promote the digital service and not be marketed or promoted. This means that digital take-up will be encouraged.

##Easily accessible support
You must be able to show, from user research, that your service’s assisted digital support is easy for users to access, at appropriate times and places.

This could mean having phone line or in person support available in the evening, and that users report acceptable wait times for an appointment or for their call to be answered.

For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see [GDS guidance on assisted digital user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research).

##Measuring the performance of support
You should be able to measure the performance of your assisted digital support. This should include measuring support provided by third party suppliers, and payment by results where relevant.

Measurements should include user satisfaction and a decrease in the number of assisted digital users. You should incentivise suppliers to improve both of these measurements, where relevant.

This enables you to demonstrate on your Performance Platform dashboard that your service’s assisted digital support is working effectively, and to look out for signs of where improvements could be made.


##The live assessment
Before your service can go fully live on the GOV.UK domain, it must pass a live assessment, which takes place during the beta phase.

To pass the live assessment, you must be able to show how you’ve built upon each phase - from discovery to alpha to the beta phases.

You may need to discuss the following topics:

* your user research, user testing and your service team
* how you designed the assisted digital support elements of your service
* how you analysed performance data and KPIs for your assisted digital support

###User research, user testing, and the service team
As the service manager, you need to explain how your team’s work in these areas continues to meet the alpha and beta requirements, and how you’ll meet them when the service goes live.

You’ll need to talk about:

* how often you carried out user research and usability testing during public beta
* what you learned, during public beta, from testing the end-to-end user journey for your assisted digital support (all routes from all providers), including any identity assurance like Verify
* any changes you’ve made in response to what you learned, using examples
* the routes and providers of assisted digital support that you tested during beta
* how you’re checking that all of the assisted digital support (all routes from all providers) will be able to handle the number of support requests you expect
* how you can be sure your assisted digital support testing was done with users who have the lowest level of digital skills, confidence and access
* how you checked users low on digital skills were users of your service
* whether the users you tested were receiving support from third parties, for example friends and family, charities, trade bodies or companies
* whether you used appropriate recruitment and research methods to reach users with low digital skills

###How you designed the assisted digital support elements of your service
You’ll need to discuss:

* whether your support model includes appropriate options for users currently choosing support from outside the model (eg from friends and family, paid intermediaries, or unsustainable, unmeasurable sources)
* how the assisted digital support has been designed and continuously improved based on what you learned from testing, metrics and user feedback
* how you chose routes and providers in the support model and why you excluded any routes (eg telephone, web chat or face by face, talk through or on-behalf-of)
* how you know that users’ needs are being met in the following areas:
  * awareness of support
  * availability of support
  * wait times for support
  * approach to digital inclusion within support
  * approach to users’ privacy
  * availability of appropriate technology and equipment
  * consistency with the support for similar government transactions

###Analysing performance data and KPIs for your assisted digital support
You’ll have to discuss:

* who in the team is responsible for identifying data that you can use to improve your assisted digital support and who’ll will do this once the service is live
* the metrics and data sources you’ve chosen to measure your assisted digital support and its performance, and why
* how you’ll measure performance of your service’s assisted digital support in future
* whether you’ve modelled user journeys that include the use of assisted digital support
* whether you can track users’ progress and identify completions and areas of poor performance
* how you’re using data analytics to find out how many users will need assisted digital support
