## What assisted digital is

The [Government Digital Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-strategy) sets out how government will become digital by default, encouraging everyone who is online to use digital services independently.

Assisted digital is support for people who can’t use online government services independently. This support will make sure that these people can access and complete government services online.

You can read more about assisted digital in the publication '[Government Approach to Assisted Digital](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/)’.

Assisted digital must be provided for all digital UK government services, in accordance with user need. Services must make support available for everyone in the UK who is entitled to use their service but is unable to access and complete it independently. Departments should be able to demonstrate a plan to support UK citizens who are resident overseas.

Assisted digital users will be helped to put their data into the digital service, or their data will be entered into the digital service on their behalf. This help could be provided by the private, voluntary or public sectors.

Assisted digital support may also include providing information about a government service or the policy behind it. This will be information that is already available on GOV.UK. Assisted digital support doesn’t include giving specialist or technical information, or advice that is not available on GOV.UK.

## Assisted digital, digital inclusion and digital take-up
Assisted digital, digital inclusion and digital take-up are different, but related.

Digital inclusion means helping people and organisations become capable of using and benefitting from the internet. It goes beyond using government services.

Assisted digital is about helping people access and complete online government services. Wherever possible, an element of learning will be included in assisted digital provision so users are able to use the service independently in future. Assisted digital and digital inclusion have similar users.

For more information on digital inclusion, read the [‘Government Digital Strategy - Action 15’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-strategy-action-15) and GDS’s [Digital Inclusion Checklist.](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/13/a-checklist-for-digital-inclusion-if-we-do-these-things-were-doing-digital-inclusion/)

The work on [increasing digital take-up](/service-manual/communications/increasing-digital-takeup) concentrates on users who can make use of digital channels. These users are therefore different from assisted digital and digital inclusion users. They can use digital services but for a range of reasons are currently preferring offline channels.

Users will move into the user group for digital take-up if they become digitally included (ie become capable of using and benefitting from the internet). Some people will never become digitally included, so will always need some form of assisted digital support.

## What good assisted digital looks like
Good assisted digital support:

* is designed to meet well-researched user needs
* is clearly signposted to users who need it, at times and places they need it
* is trusted, free and easy to access
* helps users build skills or confidence to use the online service independently
* is sustainable
* gives a good end-to-end experience as they successfully complete the service
* gives users a joined-up experience across support for multiple services across different government departments
* helps to improve the digital service
* meets users’ accessibility and legal language requirements
* securely stores and handles users’ personal data, in line with the Data Protection Act, ensuring users’ privacy is maintained

For more details, see our [assisted digital action plan](/service-manual/assisted-digital).

## Assisted digital users and their needs
It’s vital to gain a good understanding of your assisted digital users - their numbers and their needs. Only then can you put appropriate support in place. Assisted digital users include people who are offline, and people who are online but have limited digital capability - ie low experience, skills, confidence, ability and/or motivation.
Every service will have a different proportion of users who aren’t online. User research will help you to understand your users. When doing your research, use service teams and follow this advice on [assisted digital research.](/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research)

## Assisted digital channels
Assisted digital support can be provided by web chat, telephone or face by face. Assisted digital support can’t be provided via paper channels as this conflicts with the move to end-to-end digital services.

### Web chat support
Some assisted digital support can be provided on screen while the user is attempting to use the online service. This option may be triggered when a user is deemed to be struggling to complete the transaction independently. A dialogue box would allow an assisted digital provider to help the user complete the transaction.

### Phone support
Phone support may involve talking the user through the digital service as they access it themselves. This is the preferred option as it helps to build digital skills and confidence, so it’s more likely that the user will undertake the transaction as self-service in future.

Phone support may involve completing the service on behalf of the user, with the user providing information to the assisted digital provider.

### ‘Face by face’ support
Face-by-face support is different from ‘face to face’ (ie an over-the-counter service where the user can’t see the provider’s screen). With face by face, the user sits alongside the assisted digital provider so that they can both see the digital service on the screen. The assisted digital support provider then guides the user to complete the transaction themselves. 

This is the preferred approach, although services must also recognise that the assisted digital provider may need to type in the information provided by a user if they’re unable to type it in themselves.

Through provision of face-by-face support we want the user to learn digital skills and build confidence, so that many people who initially seek assisted digital support are able to self-serve in future.

Face-by-face support takes place either at the provider’s location (high street or office) or as an ‘outreach’ visit (eg at the user's home or in hospital). For all face-by-face services, a private area should be provided if personal data is being given.

## Assisted digital support must be sustainably funded
Departments may not currently be funding the assisted digital support that their users receive. It may be being paid for by:

* a different government department
* a non-government funding body
* charitable donations
* the citizen

Alternatively, the user might be relying on friends and family to provide the assisted digital support they need.

Government must provide funded assisted digital support for users who need it, although users may prefer to find assisted digital support elsewhere. This makes sure the service is sustainable and that no one is excluded from using it on the basis of cost. Government can’t rely on others to give assisted digital support to their service users.

## GDS’s approach to assisted digital
GDS is working with exemplar departments on a cross-government model to provide high-quality assisted digital support for those who really need it. Whether provided in-house or externally, all services must understand their assisted digital requirements and provide high-quality and value for money support.
GDS is leading the procurement activities for a single cross-government route for commissioning assisted digital support of this standard (with support from the Crown Commercial Service).  The commissioning route will be scaleable and offer value for money assisted digital support.
The commissioning route will look to provide for a wide range of transaction volumes and offer assisted digital providers with the requisite level of training.
Assisted digital users may also have general enquiries related to the service. This information will be on GOV.UK as part of the digital service, so it will be easy for the assisted digital provider to access on the assisted digital user’s behalf.

## Departmental approaches to assisted digital
Some services may want to use alternatives to the cross-government commissioning route for assisted digital support. These services should discuss options with GDS early on in the planning stage and will need to demonstrate how the alternative support provides value for money and a high-quality service, in line with the [assisted digital action plan](/service-manual/assisted-digital).

Services may need to use an alternative commissioning route because of responsibilities to devolved administrations, namely legal accountability to both the UK government and devolved governments. 

Services could also have legal or statutory reasons why assisted digital provision must be provided by a specified supplier. These cases should be discussed with GDS in the early stages of planning to make sure that an appropriate service is provided.

Services may have existing contracts for providing outsourced assisted digital. Services will still need to provide evidence that their assisted digital support meets user needs and will be expected to move to the commissioning vehicle when the contract comes to an end.

## Authenticating user identity

Services that include a requirement for users to authenticate their identity before undertaking a digital transaction should refer to GDS’s [Identity Assurance](/service-manual/identity-assurance) guidance and [contact](mailto:janet.hughes@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)  the Identity Assurance (IDA) team at GDS at the earliest opportunity. GDS are developing IDA as the default identity assurance platform within government digital services.
