Most of your users will be able to use new and redesigned services unaided, but there are some who will need help. This support is referred to as assisted digital.

Assisted digital support might be provided in person, on the phone, or through other appropriate channels. Users will be given help to use the service, or someone will use it alongside them on their behalf.

You can read more about assisted digital in the publication '[Government Approach to Assisted Digital](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/)’.

##The users who need assisted digital support

Assisted digital support is for users who are not able to use digital services without help. 18% of UK adults are offline and the GDS ‘Digital Landscape Research’ provides [a demographic breakdown](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#fig-5) of who is online and who is offline.

Every service will have a different proportion of users who aren’t online, so understanding your [users' needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html) is vital for putting in place the appropriate support.

[User research](/service-manual/user-centred-design/introduction-to-user-research.html) will help you to understand your users. When doing your research, use service teams and [user research techniques](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research#tips-for-user-research).

Consider the digital skills of your users. This will help you understand -- out of those not using digital channels -- which users:

* won’t ever be able to use the digital service independently and will always need assisted digital support
* could use the digital service independently, but will need assisted digital support at the beginning to build their confidence in using the service
* should use the digital service (ie have the digital skills, but currently use non-digital channels) and don’t need assisted digital support

Your service might not need to provide assisted digital support, eg your users are large corporations.

##What ‘good’ looks like

Good assisted digital support:

* is based on [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html)
* acts as an alternative way to access the digital service
* includes an opportunity to learn, and encourages users to use the digital service independently in the future (where appropriate)
* can be provided externally from government, ie by the private and voluntary sectors
* replaces existing non-digital channels, such as phone or face--to--face, as the demand for them decreases

For more details, see our [assisted digital action plan](/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html).

##What assisted digital support will look like

Assisted digital support must follow shared models of assisted digital and be procured from the private and voluntary and community sector to make sure it’s consistent. Shared models and procurement routes are currently being developed by GDS and departments in conjunction with the Government Procurement Service (GPS). For more information, see the publication ‘[Government Approach to Assisted Digital](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/)’.

Only in exceptional circumstances can a department ask for an exemption from this requirement, eg where a business case for using external resources doesn’t demonstrate good value for money.

Moving from in-house to external resources will be phased in as the marketplace of assisted digital providers is established.

Where an alternative channel remains, it must be redesigned to provide assisted digital support.

##How we’re developing an approach to assisted digital

Departments and GDS are working together to develop assisted digital support for the [exemplar digital by default services](https://www.gov.uk/transformation). The experiences with these services will inform shared models and shared procurement routes for assisted digital.

If you’re not an exemplar service but would like to get involved in this work, please [contact GDS](/service-manual/feedback).
