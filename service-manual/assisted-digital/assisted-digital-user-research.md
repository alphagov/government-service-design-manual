##Researching assisted digital users -- a guide for service managers

To meet the Digital Service Standard, you will need to show that you have designed your assisted digital support based on your [users’ needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs).

You can gain a detailed understanding of your assisted digital users and their needs by carrying out lots of user research. This also means [learning how to plan and test your assisted digital support](/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan) and how to make sure that users know where to go for help.

##Understanding your assisted digital users and their needs

An assisted digital user is someone who can’t use a digital government service independently. This includes people who are offline with no digital skills, and people who are online but only have limited digital skills.

Every service has different proportions of assisted digital users. During the discovery and alpha stages, you need to:

* develop an understanding of how many of your users need assisted digital support
* work out their demographic makeup
* learn what their needs are

###Where to start

Start by looking at who currently uses the offline channels for your service and then map out where people go for help. This help could range from general enquiries to specific questions on things like eligibility or form filling. It may include help provided by:

* other government departments
* third parties, such as charities or businesses
* informal sources
* family and friends

Look at which of your users access these sources of help and find out why. You can then use this information to work out how many of these users will need assisted digital support.

You should also look at existing management information about your service, such as user data, transcripts and user feedback from your contact centres. Find out whether your department or service has carried out any recent research (qualitative or quantitative) on your users. Look through it to find out if it can provide any insights about who your users are and who faces barriers to going online.

Add to any existing insight with new, targeted research so you can find out more about your assisted digital users and their needs.

###Finding users for your research sessions

You need to find out if your users lack:

* confidence with using computers and the internet
* online experience
* access to a device (computer, tablet, phone etc)
* access to the internet
* trust in sharing personal information online
* full physical or cognitive ability

To recruit suitable users for your research, you should talk to people and organisations who already help your users, such as:

* staff in your department
* organisations that help people to develop digital skills
* intermediaries - eg charities, lawyers, libraries, Citizens Advice or commercial agents

You should also consider employing the services of user research recruitment agencies to recruit to a specific but relevant [research brief](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/user-research-briefs). You may need to explain your recruitment specification at your beta assessment against the Service Standard.

###User research methods

Speak with staff and volunteers, as well as end-users of your service, and make sure researched users have either no or low digital skills. It’s also important to do your research in places where vulnerable users will feel more comfortable. This might be a library, community centre, religious centre and places where support groups meet.

You, or any agency you use, must use offline methods for your research, as online methods aren’t suitable for users with no or low digital skills. Additionally, [ethnographic research](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/ethnographic-research) is more suitable for hard to reach and vulnerable users than lab-based research.

Research methods that work well with assisted digital users include:

* one-to-one interviews (find out more on [focus groups and interviews](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/focus-groups-mini-groups-interviews))
* ethnographic research
* ‘a day in a life’ techniques
* diary studies
* user journey mapping
* surveys (conducted through offline channels your users already use, like a contact centre or support group)

Learn more about [user research techniques and research methods](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/index).

You can also find more information on [user research surveys](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/user-research-surveys), including [survey design](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/survey-design) and [survey sampling methodologies](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/sampling-methodologies).

##Creating an assisted digital plan

By the end of the alpha stage, you’ll need to have a plan ready for testing your assisted digital support before your service moves to GOV.UK.

As you gather more data and insight about your assisted digital users, you also need to build up an understanding of their levels of digital skills by mapping them onto the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#annex-2-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals).

You must also use the digital inclusion scale to understand how difficult your digital service is to complete during each stage of development. GDS has published an initial analysis of how complex the [exemplar services](https://www.gov.uk/transformation) are. We considered criteria like how long the service takes to complete on average and how easy the service is to use on a mobile device. The analyses [are published here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are) - you should refer to them to help you analyse the complexity of your own service.

###Creating user personas

Using your data and insight, create user personas that represent your assisted digital users. User personas allow you to look at the journey of each assisted digital user through your digital service. This makes it easier to work out which parts of your digital service these users find difficult or impossible to complete and why.

We’ve created 8 user personas that represent people who need help to use government services online. The personas are based on desk and field research and represent real-life stories. The users were vulnerable people who needed urgent help using a variety of government services:

Your service-specific personas, along with these examples, will help you to [write good user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories) on what your users need and why.
This means you’ll understand any specific user needs, including which channels will work best for them. You must use these needs to create your plan for assisted digital support.

##Testing your assisted digital support

You must test your plan with real assisted digital users when your service is in the early stage of beta. You must then continue to test your assisted digital support and gather user insights once your service has moved to GOV.UK.

You need to:

* test all channels that are relevant for your assisted digital users
* set up ways to get ongoing feedback from users about your assisted digital support
* set and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)

This will help you to provide evidence that your service will meet user needs, is high quality and provides good value for money.

Use this feedback to iterate the assisted digital support and continue to ask for feedback from users, providers and experts. This will make sure the support meets user needs throughout the beta and live phases. You must share your findings with GDS and other service managers.

##Making sure your users know where to find help

For your service to go live, you must have evidence showing that the users who need help are aware of the support and can easily find it.
It should be clear and easy to see that there is support available, but not be marketed or promoted - this helps to encourage [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup). In the first instance, you need to point users towards a needs assessment to check their eligibility for assisted digital support.

Information about the availability of support (eg phone line numbers and opening hours, or office locations and opening hours) must encourage people to use the online service. You should provide this information in places where assisted digital users already go for help and advice, through existing communication channels with users, and on the service’s start page on GOV.UK.

The language you use must be simple and clear. With real users, test
the wording and design of your physical messaging (eg posters, banners and leaflets) and the content on GOV.UK. Use their feedback to improve and iterate on your messaging.
