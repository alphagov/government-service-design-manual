#User research surveys

This guidance looks at how user surveys can be used to provide user research to help design new products and services.

##Guidance/Tool
 
Surveys can be conducted either face to face by a trained moderator or through self-completion (online, postal etc.) in order to quantify thoughts/beliefs, behaviours, ownership etc. Surveys comprise of closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide verbatim responses.
 
A range of survey methods and delivery channels are available including:
 

* Online web surveys – self-completion surveys used to obtain information from web users. Surveys are activated when a user interacts with a page – this can either be through arriving/leaving a page, or clicking on a link. A piece of computer script is used to control the frequency at which users are invited to take part in a survey eg 1:n users will get invited to take a specific survey. In order to increase completion rates, online surveys are normally no longer than 5-10 mins in length (approximately 20 – 25 questions). 
* Email survey – these are identical in set up and design to online web surveys, except participants are asked to complete them via an email, and not at random when they visit a website. Email surveys are often more targeted as participants can be identified by information already known about the them eg demographic, information usage etc.
* Telephone interviews – structured interviews that are conducted over the phone by a trained moderator.
* Face to face interviews – like telephone interviews, face to face interviews are structured and conducted by a trained moderator. Unlike other survey methods, respondents may be shown limited stimulus – eg advert, leaflet cover. website design etc. Face to face interviews also enable researchers to target respondents more easily by demographic, geographic and socio economic group.
 
##Where/how you might use it
 
Surveys can be a relatively cheap and quick way of gathering and quantifying public opinion and monitoring change over time. Online/email surveys are normally the cheapest method as these can be conducted in-house using inexpensive/free survey software, inviting people to take part from their own website, or using a database of email addresses. Although sometimes a small cost may be incurred if an incentive is used (eg competition to win vouchers etc.). Telephone and face interviews are the most costly methodology and they are normally conducted via a third party agency. Cost can, however be kept down by conducting interviews as part of an Omnibus survey which involves questions from a variety of subjects (from a number of clients) being asked during the same interview, as well as the demographic information on each respondent. Omnibus surveys can be conducted online, telephone, and face to face.
 
Surveys can be used to size a market to find out how many people own a product, or take part in an activity eg how many people use the Internet in the UK. They can be also used to understand usage and attitudes towards a product or activity eg how often people use the Internet, how they access it, why the use it etc. Complex analysis can be also be conducted to understand key drivers of attitude/behaviour, segmentation of audiences, and trade offs between different opinions etc.
 
Surveys provide a snapshot of opinion, and are a useful method for monitoring uptake, usage and attitudes over time.
 
##Weaknesses/when not to use
 
Although surveys can be a quick and cheap manner in which to conduct user research, there are certain aspects, which should be considered when they are used:
 
* Normally don’t allow much time or context for considered replies.
* Questions can be misunderstood – surveys need to be designed carefully to avoid this.
* Completion bias – one common criticism of some types of surveys is that they are only completed by people who have something to say eg are either very satisfied or very dissatisfied. This can be overcome via face to face interviews and / or sophisticated sampling techniques, although this is normally expensive. 
 
##Participants
 
All surveys, regardless of methodology should use a robust sample that is nationally representative/representative of audience of interest. Most nationally representative surveys are 1,000 people or more, but can be significantly larger if there are a number of distinct user groups that are being targeted.
 
It is important that the delivery channel used considers the target audience. For example in the recent Digital Landscape research an online and face-to-face methodology was used as online and offline audiences needed to be interviewed - an online only methodology would have excluded those who are offline, and the opinions on this audience omitted from the research
 
It is also important to note that reaching hard-to-reach groups can be more time consuming and costly (eg BME, people with disabilities).
 
##Cost
 
The costs can vary depending on scale, reach and method – as detailed previously, online surveys are generally cheap, while face to face interviews are more costly. Cost ranges from free (just in-house resource) to £100k+. 

##Timescales
 
Again this depends on research method and reach. Face to face interviews are more time consuming, and typically take 6-8 weeks from assigning an agency to delivery of results.
