Conducting user research helps us to understand our users better. It’s how we find out what they're currently doing, how they're doing something, what they want, what they think they want, and what we think they want. All of this helps us to define the [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs).

We use a range of methods, techniques and approaches to tease that insight out in order to inform design, development and improvement of our products and services. 

## What kind of research and when?

In the [discovery phase](/service-manual/phases/discovery.html) you want to understand the way users currently interact with a service, ideally in the environment they would do it ‘normally’. [Etnographic research](/service-manual/users/ethnographic-research.html) is useful for that. 

Further down the product development life cycle, when you have [a prototype or wireframes](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html), [usability testing](/service-manual/users/remote-usability.html) will help you understand ways your users interact with your solutions to their needs.

Then, in [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html) and beyond, quantitative methods like [surveys and feedback questionnaires](/service-manual/users/survey-design.html) can help you understand what problems are emerging for increasing numbers of users.

Generally, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods will give you a broad understanding of users needs and how you can improve services to meet those needs.

## Tips for user research

Three things to keep in mind while conducting research will help you deliver a service that meets [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index.html);

* really get to know your users, have a deep understanding of their needs and how to meet them
* be clear on where your product is in its lifecycle,b ecause you can then choose particular methods or techniques to conduct some research that will be appropriate at that particular time
* get the team who are developing your product or service involved with the research as well, because everyone needs to understand the users to build a successful service

## User research techniques

The following techniques may be useful when conducting user research:

* [card sorting](/service-manual/users/card-sorting.html)
* [multivariate testing](/service-manual/users/user-research/multivariate-testing.html)
* [user research surveys](/service-manual/users/user-research/user-research-surveys.html)
* [sentiment analysis](/service-manual/users/user-research/sentiment-analysis.html)
* [ethnographic research](/service-manual/users/user-research/ethnographic-research.html)
* [expert review](/service-manual/users/user-research/expert-review.html)
* [guerilla testing](/service-manual/users/user-research/guerilla-testing.html)
* [same day user testing](/service-manual/users/user-research/same-day-user-testing.html)
* [lab based user testing](/service-manual/users/user-research/lab-based-user-testing.html)
* [focus groups and 1:1 interviews](/service-manual/users/user-research/focus-groups-mini-groups-interviews.html)
* [community user groups](/service-manual/users/user-research/community-user-groups.html)
* [remote usability/summative testing](/service-manual/users/user-research/remote-usability.html)
* [online research panels](/service-manual/users/user-research/online-research-panels.html)
* [online omnibus surveying](/service-manual/users/user-research/online-omnibus-survey.html)

The following resources will be useful for those conducting user research:

* [discussion guides](/service-manual/users/user-research/discussion-guides.html)
* [sampling methodologies](/service-manual/users/user-research/sampling-methodologies.html)
* [survey design](/service-manual/users/user-research/survey-design.html)
* [user research tools](/service-manual/users/user-research/user-research-tools.html)
