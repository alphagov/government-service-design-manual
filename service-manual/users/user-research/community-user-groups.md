An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks. 

## How research communities work

The types of community differ, and vary in openness, permanency and size. A typical community will be private, often have between 300-500 members and focus on building relationships between participants. This type of community offers a great source of deep insight over long periods of time. 

## Where and how you might use it

The tasks given to a research community differ in format and can include; online forums, blogs, polls, surveys, instant chat and more. Tasks are usually creative, and ask different questions relating to the research objective/s.

Research communities can be used for a wide range of projects such as audience understanding, diary studies, concept development or simply idea generation. They allow a business to get close to users and offer meaningful dialogue between an organisation and its customers.

The key benefits are:

* rapid speed (questions are answered in real time, research team can react rapidly to internal demands)
* cost effective when up and running 
* flexibility
* availability
* rich outputs (visual content such as video is regularly used and is impactful)
* deep insights
* raises profile of research internally when insight is relevant and timely

## When not to use

Communities require constant management. Participants need to be kept engaged, which means daily interaction, new questions and inventive approaches to maintain their interest. 

The community needs constant moderation, usually by a research manager or third party research agency. The quality of community members is paramount. Their feedback needs to be quality checked and panel attrition needs to be monitored on an on-going basis to ensure fresh ideas. 

## Participants

Participants can be obtained using public postings on websites, email groups and social media, or via third party sample companies.
