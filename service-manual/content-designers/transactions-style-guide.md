##Style guide for services

Using the government standards for style, logic and content design will help you build services that meet user needs.

Building services from the user’s perspective and then developing services based on [users’ needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html) is essential to your project’s success.

This guide is itself in the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha). The guide’s continued success depends on service managers telling us what works with their users. Please share your ideas and research insights on the [mailing list for service designers](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)


##GOV.UK style
Follow the [GOV.UK style guide](/design-principles/style-guide) for language and style, eg tone of voice, plain English guidance, and any particular points of style like abbreviations, capitalisation etc.

##Name of your service
Make sure users can easily find your service through search engines like Google. Optimise the title of your service. 

[Read more on search engine optimisation](/design-principles/style-guide#seo).

##Consistency and clarity

###Be consistent and specific
Language and labelling must be consistent throughout your service, eg don’t switch from ‘last name’ to ‘family name’. 

Tell users exactly what you want them to do. Don’t invent words to ‘sum up’ the user action. 

Example:<br/>
Tell HMRC about a change to your company car. 

Instead of:<br/>
File an HMRC change request.

###Don’t assume the user has previous knowledge
Avoid any jargon and ‘insider’ words. Users won’t know what you’re talking about. When writing copy for your service always ask yourself ‘what does this actually mean?’ and ‘what information do I want the user to give me?’.

When you get close to the subject matter it’s sometimes easy to use ‘insider language’. User research will show you what users understand and where they stumble. 

###Think about the user’s learning curve
If you’re building a service that users log on to regularly, eg every week or month, they will soon know what you’re talking about. 

For these services you can use shorter names but you must still be specific. For example, you can use ‘Other taxes’ instead of ‘Other taxes you can register for’. But don’t use ‘Other services’. 

Call things in your service what they are to make the learning curve easy for users. For example, use ‘Other taxes you need to register for’ instead of ‘Other services’.

You can also:

* explain things that are specific to your service when users register or log in for the first time
* give the option to switch off explanations within the service 


##Logic flow

###Start with the majority of users
Find out how the majority of users will use the service and focus on this path first, then add niche scenarios where needed. 

###User’s perspective
Approach the logic from a user’s perspective rather than how the information is processed later on. 

User research will give you insight into how the user would use the service. 

###Only ask what you need to know
Before you start building your service, write out a list of the information you need from the user and why you need it. For example, ‘need to know their income so that we can subtract income over £100 a week from benefit paid’. 

This will force you to think through each piece of information you’re asking the user to give you. Remember, just because it’s in your current service, doesn’t mean you need it. 

###Once is enough
Make sure you only ask for information once. This seems obvious but in a long service it’s easy to miss and users can lose confidence in a service that lacks consistency and logic. For example, don’t ask for the user’s birth date and then later in the service for their age.

##Addressing the user

###Addressing the user as ‘you’
Always address the user as ‘you’ and use ‘your’ for headings and labelling where appropriate, eg ‘Your account’ or just ‘Account’ instead of ‘My account’ or ‘You agree to the terms and conditions’ instead of ‘I agree to the terms and conditions’. 

As a general rule don’t use ‘my’ or ‘I’. 

If the user has to give information about other people, be clear whose details you’re asking for, eg ‘Your address’ and ‘Your partner’s address’. Give a ‘Same address as you’ option to populate these fields dynamically. 

###Services with multiple users
Where multiple users have access to the same service, use the name of the person logged in, eg ‘Susan’s account details’. 

If users have roles and permissions, spell out what these are. 

Example:<br/>
Susan’s account details

You’re the accountant for Ladida Ltd.<br/>
You can send tax returns on behalf of Ladida Ltd.<br/>

###Referring to your organisation
At the start of the service make clear which organisation the user is dealing with, eg ‘Apply for funding from Defra’. After that you can refer to your organisation as ‘we’. 

If the circumstances are ambiguous or there is more than one party involved, use the name of your organisation throughout, eg ‘HMRC will get back to you in 7 working days’. 

Test with users if they understand who ‘we’ is. Email your insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

##Writing questions 

The same rules apply to writing questions or steps.  

###Making your questions easy to understand
Keep questions short and straightforward. After you’ve written them take a step back and ask yourself ‘what do I actually want the user to do?’. Check your questions for any jargon. Words you use on your project to describe things usually don’t mean anything for users. 

Ask users in research to describe what they’re doing in your service. Use the words they use. 

Usually you’ll have 3 types of questions in your service:

* simple questions: users will know the answers without help, eg ‘What’s your date of birth?’
* lookup questions: users don’t need help but they have to look up the information first, eg ‘What’s your bank account number?’
* complex questions: users need to think before they can answer them and will probably need help, eg ‘Did you not use your car at any time in the last 30 days? Only answer if it was for 5 days in a row.’

Your questions don’t have to be questions, you can also use statements, eg ‘What is your date of birth?’ or ‘Date of birth’. This depends on the format of your service. However, you have to be consistent and keep reading to a minimum. Don’t use ‘What’s your date of birth’ followed by ‘Contact details’ on the same page. 

###Telling the user why you’re asking a question
When you’re asking for sensitive or additional information, tell the user why using help text. For example, when you’re asking about their partner’s details. Users often don’t understand what this has to do with to their own application.

Example:<br/>
What’s your partner’s income?

[help text] Your household income is your and your partner’s income. To calculate it correctly we have to ask about your partner’s finances. 

User research will show you which questions users have an issue with. Email your insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

###Number of questions 
Keep the number of questions to a minimum. Remember, users are most likely reluctant to use your service in the first place. Each question adds to their frustration and opens the door for mistakes to be entered. 

Often it’s possible to get the same amount of information with fewer questions. 

For example, instead of asking users 10 questions about their personal circumstances you can group these into a checklist. 

Example: Your circumstances

Use: Which of these apply to you?

Choose all that apply [from this checklist]:

* you have a spouse or partner.
* you’re registered for Self Assessment.
* your household income is £30,000 or more.

The checklist is simpler for users than 3 separate questions:

* are you married or in a civil partnership?
* are you registered for Self Assessment?
* is your household income £30,000 or more?

##Help text and error messages

###Help text
Keep it short and concise and speak to the user in their language. Users are unlikely to read anything longer than 3 lines. Focus on user action. Don’t give background information, eg ‘This used to be called X but in 2008 it was changed to Y’. 

Example:<br/>
Enter the years you’ve paid National Insurance.

[help text] These are the years you’ve worked and paid tax or the years when you’ve received benefits like Jobseeker’s Allowance. 

Instead of:<br/>
National Insurance contributions can consist of Class 1 payments for employed, Class 2 payments for self employed or voluntary Class 3 payments. There may be certain years when you’ve received benefits that cover some of your National Insurance contributions. If this is the case, you must also count those years. 

Only if you really can’t fit help text on the page or when it’s an edge case you should use help links, eg ‘What does this mean?’ or ‘What’s X?’. However, this isn’t a dumping ground for long ‘lazy’ help text. 

Don’t send the user out of the service to read long guidance documents. They won’t.

###Error messages
On the top of the page tell the user where they went wrong and how they can fix it:

There was a problem with the information you entered:

- Name and address -- you must enter this
- Bank details -- your sort code is incorrect
etc

Give the user a message in each field where an error occurred. 

Name and address
[Enter a name]
[Enter an address]


##Who is eligible and who isn’t
There isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ answer for this. How you present eligibility criteria depends on your service. 

Different service exemplars have tried out these things:

* upfront eligibility checker, eg a short smart answer 
* short list of the main eligibility rules on the start page
* keeping eligibility in mind when ordering your questions: try to cover the main eligibility related questions early on (but avoid turning this into a random bunch of questions)
* a dynamically generated order of questions: users only see questions relating to their specific eligibility group, eg users who aren’t working shouldn’t see any questions about employment
* validate questions within your service so that they kick out  users who aren’t eligible, eg ‘Enter a UK postcode’, validation: ‘You can’t register without a UK address’

Things that don’t work very well:

* long bullet lists of eligibility criteria on the start page
* links to ‘see guidance notes’ within a service that send users to long-winded documents
* when it’s not clear what’s the eligibility checker and what’s the actual application 
* eligibility checkers asking the same questions that will be asked in the service later on as users find this very frustrating

##Headings 
All headings must be sentence case, eg ‘Your tax account’ not ‘Your Tax Account’. However, where a proper noun appears in the heading this is upper case, eg ‘Your National Insurance contributions’. Check the section on capitalisation in the [GOV.UK style guide](/design-principles/style-guide/style-points#style-capitalisation).

Headings must give the user a clear indication where they are in the service. The name of your service should be on every page.

Avoid words like ‘more’ or ‘further’ in headings, eg ‘About you’ followed by ‘More about you’. In this example ‘Personal details’ followed by ‘Contact details’ would be useful.


##Labels
Use sentence case: the first word is always upper case, the rest is lower case, eg ‘Date of birth’ instead of ‘Date of Birth’. 

Exceptions are personal names and proper nouns, eg National Insurance number, Child Benefit etc. 

Don’t invent proper nouns, eg don’t say ‘Check your Identity Profile’. 

###Mandatory and optional fields
Mandatory fields don’t need special labelling. Don’t use asterisks *. 

Generally, there shouldn’t be any optional fields because you either need the user to give you the information or you don’t. 

If there are optional fields they should be marked (optional) immediately after the field label text so that screen readers catch them before getting to the field. 

Example:<br/>
Maiden name (optional) [free text field]

###Names
Use one freetext field: Name. 

Use the following format as applicable if backend or business requires that you separate names:

- first name
- middle name (if needed)
- last name
- any other names (eg maiden name) 

You can use this format if your service is used by many users outside the UK:

- given name(s)
- family name
- any other names (eg maiden name)

If your research shows that users don’t understand this labelling, eg users whose first language isn’t English, email insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

###Titles
You don’t have to use titles in your service.

If you do, use this format:

* Mr
* Ms
* Other [when selected this switches to a free text field]

You can give examples for ‘Other’ that fit with your service. 

###Addresses
The preferred option is to have a postcode lookup with a ‘Your address not listed’ option. Users should also be able to edit the address they choose from the lookup. 

You should also have an ‘Enter address manually’ option for users who don’t want to use postcode lookup. 

NB: postcode is one word. 

Use the following labelling for ‘Your address is not listed’:

Name<br/>
or<br/>
First name (if backend needs separate fields)<br/>
Last name (if backend needs separate fields)<br/>
<br/>
Address<br/>
Address<br/>
Address<br/>
City<br/>
Postcode<br/>
Country (where appropriate)<br/>
<br/>
Telephone:<br/>
Email:<br/>

If you find in research that users don’t understand this labelling, email insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

###Nationality
This is an alphabetical country drop down. You can have ‘United Kingdom’ as the first option. 

If you test other ideas, email insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

###Date of birth
This is a drop down with the following labelling:

* day
* month
* [free number text] 

You can test other formats, eg one free text box with help about the date format. Email your insights to [digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digital-service-designers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

###Bank details
Use the following labelling and single free text boxes for user input:

Bank or building society details

Account holder

Bank or building society

Sort code 

Account number

Roll number for building societies (if needed) 

For international services use:

Account holder
Bank or building society
IBAN
BIC

###National Insurance number
Use a single free text box labelled: National Insurance number. 

Remember that ‘number’ isn’t capitalised and don’t call National Insurance number ‘NINO’.

###Dates
When asking for date ranges make sure the validation forces the user to enter consecutive dates or show an error message. You can add days of the week to help the user with this. 

Example:<br/>
Enter the dates when you were abroad<br/>
From [day] [month] [year] to [day] [month] [year]

Validation example: 09/03/2013 to 12/11/2012<br/>
Error message: Your end date must be after the start date.

When asking for past or future dates make sure validation starts from today’s date. Show an error message if user input isn’t in the past or future. 

Periods of time when used in questions or help text should follow the format in this example: 
8 July to 9 August.

Send any other labels you’re using to [hinrich.von-haaren@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:hinrich.von-haaren@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).


###Progress bars
Make sure these actually reflect what users have to do on each page. Avoid using general terms like ‘other’ or ‘more information’. 

##Start and done pages

###Confirm or ‘submit’ page
You can have a confirm page in your service but you don’t have to. The purpose of this page is for the user to check anything they’ve done before they send it. 

Example:<br/>
Check your updated income details before making the change. 

Your income for this tax year: £25,000

[button] Make the change  

The button label should tell the user what it is they’re going to do, eg ‘Change your tax details’ or ‘Send your claim form’. Don’t just use ‘Submit’ or ‘Confirm’. 

You can use a generic label if the action is too long, eg ‘Send’ or ‘Apply’ or ‘Make the change’. 

Users must actively say that they’ve understood what they’re signing up for if terms and conditions are part of your service. This can, for example, be an opt-in box or the user can type in a confirmation.  

###End or thank you page
Adapt this format of the end page for your needs:

Thank you. 

You’ve [user action]. 

Example:
You’ve sent your Carer’s Allowance claim. 

What happens next
[include things like when the user will hear back, contact number for questions]

[include links to other related services or things within the service user can do]

[button with link to GOV.UK done page] Finished 
or 
[link to GOV.UK done page] Sign out

Make sure the copy on this page matches what you asked the user to do at the beginning of the service, eg Remove a benefit, end page: You’ve removed Jobseeker’s Allowance. 

##Sign in or log in
Use ‘sign in’ instead of ‘log in’.

###Start and done pages
GDS will write and upload the start and done pages on GOV.UK. Raise a ticket in Zendesk and send a summary of what your service does and what the user will get at the end of it, plus the 3 main pieces of information the user needs to get through the service, eg their National Insurance number, date of birth, bank account number.

Also include a list the most important keywords for search engine optimisation because pages within the service won’t be indexed in GOV.UK search. 

Use the [GOV.UK SEO guidance](/design-principles/style-guide#seo) for headings, introductions and metadata descriptions.
