Teams using agile approaches often manage their work on a wall in their work area. The wall creates a physical focus for the team and for collaboration -- people gather round it at their daily stand-up and refer to and update it during the day. This lets them collaborate effectively with each other and shows the status of their work to anyone who looks at the wall. This is called ‘visual management’. 

Visiting teams and seeing their walls for yourself is an essential governance activity. A good wall conveys the information you need to support a team in a simple, clear manner. It also supports effective decision-making. 

If a wall can’t be easily understood (eg it’s not immediately clear where the team is blocked), it’s up to the team’s delivery manager to make improvements.

###What goes on a wall

Different teams need to use different information to manage their work, so walls will differ from team to team. However, most walls are used to manage what:

+ the team have yet to start work on
+ they’re currently doing
+ they’ve already done

Work to do is represented as cards that are moved along the wall. Sometimes cards are annotated, eg to show who’s working on them or that the work is blocked.

Team walls capture the flow of work through different stages.

The team should also track:

+ progress against their goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) -- for live data this could be shown on an electronic dashboard like the [GDS performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance)
+ risks and issues
+ major obstacles to delivery (‘blockers’)
+ important deadlines and dependencies

Information about the service and team is also commonly shown, like:

+ the service vision
+ who is in the team
+ what their working arrangements are, eg when their show and tells are held 

###Examples of walls

<img src="/service-manual/assets/images/governance/simple-wall.jpg" alt="A simple wall">

This wall is used to manage a software team’s work. It shows their goals, successes and a simple flow of tasks: to do - in progress - in review - to deploy - done. The coloured stickers are used to show who’s working on each task.

Teams can also use walls to manage complicated tasks:

This is a section of the wall used to manage the transfer of departments and agency websites to GOV.UK. It uses a similar flow of tasks but on a much larger scale.

Using physical walls like these creates a focus for the team and promotes transparency - anyone walking past can have a look. 

Sometimes it’s useful to use an online tool as well as the wall - eg to track delivery history or manage a large backlog. For example, a major, heavily-used service may have hundreds of fault tickets or non-urgent suggestions for change that are best tracked electronically.
