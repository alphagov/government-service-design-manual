There are [5 phases of service delivery](/service-manual/phases) --- discovery, alpha, beta, live and retirement. Governance is important across all these phases and ensures the transition between them is seamless. People who govern must anticipate problems that could affect delivery and make sure it isn't slowed down.


##Discovery

During discovery your team will be uncovering new information rapidly and you’ll need to support it by making decisions about the direction of the product and removing blockers.

You’ll use this phase to:

* establish conditions for delivering a successful service

* decide whether to proceed to alpha

* review and adjust your team and governance for alpha based on what you learn

You may need approval from Cabinet Office to spend money on suppliers and should start work on your business case.

##Alpha

Your team will be testing prototypes with users and you’ll start to get a feel for what the service could look like.

You’ll use this phase to:

* decide whether to proceed to beta

* review and adjust your team and governance for beta based on what you learn

You may need approval from Cabinet Office to spend money on suppliers and continue to work on your business case.

To progress to beta you’ll need to:

* complete a business case and get approval for it

* get Cabinet Office spend control approval, if necessary

* prepare for and pass a digital by default service standard assessment

You must ensure you do these things in enough time to enable the delivery team to move from alpha straight into the beta phase. You'll slow down delivery if you don't.

##Beta

The purpose of beta is to develop the service and test it with users. As you do this, you may need to scale to achieve your objectives.

You should adjust governance arrangements to make sure that they fit your scale and structure for this phase. You’ll also need to update your business case and get further Cabinet Office spend control approval for the service if you’re spending money on external resources (eg suppliers).

If you move outside agreed tolerances for costs and benefits you will need investment re-approval. To move into live service operations, you’ll need to pass a service standard assessment.

##Live

You’ll need to make sure that you have the resources and practices in place to continuously and iteratively improve the service. This will make sure it responds to changing user needs and policy development. 

The service standard assessment process will apply if the service undergoes a major change.

##Retirement

An existing service may be withdrawn or replaced. If you do this, you’ll need to indicate what, if anything, users are expected to do instead, or signpost them to the replacement service.

As part of shutting down a service you must ensure that data is held according to regulatory or policy requirements.
