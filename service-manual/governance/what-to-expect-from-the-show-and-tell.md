###Why you should go to show and tells

This is a meeting that happens every few weeks in the delivery team work area. It gives you a chance to:

+ see the most important work the team has done during that period
+ hear their plans for the next few weeks
+ listen to them and ask questions to understand how you can support them
+ get a sense of what the team’s mood is

Participating in show and tells is an essential governance activity. It’s the best way for people who govern to see progress because you get to look at or use what’s being developed by the team and form your own view of how they’re meeting user needs. You’ll also leave the show and tell with information to share with the wider organisation afterwards.

Even early in the development of a service (in the [discovery](/service-manual/phases/discovery) and [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha) phases), there are many things that the team can do to demonstrate the outcomes of their work. This gives you the chance to offer feedback to help shape what the team does next.

###How show and tells work

The delivery team runs the show and tell, but you can ask for specific things to be shown. It’s the team’s responsibility to make sure the meeting is useful to the people there. You should check with them beforehand to understand what will be expected of you.

The show and tell is an opportunity for you to ask questions about the work done and provide feedback. It’s not an opportunity to argue for changes in the team’s plans or challenge their user research - if you have concerns around these, take them up with the service manager before the meeting.

Check with the team before inviting others. If a larger group wants to see progress, you should organise a separate presentation-style meeting.

The team will highlight issues, dependencies, assumptions and risks that are affecting them but the meeting isn’t a forum for detailed review or discussion of these.

You should be prepared to make decisions that unblock the team and tell them how you're dealing with dependencies and risks outside their control. If you can’t unblock them immediately you should work with them to do so as quickly as possible to [avoid slowing down delivery](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#dont-slow-down-delivery).
