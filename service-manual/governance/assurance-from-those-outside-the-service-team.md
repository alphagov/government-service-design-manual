Sometimes people not directly involved in day to day delivery of a service can spot things that people in the team are less likely to see because they’re too close to the work. This type of external assurance can:

+ provide extra confidence to the delivery team and people who govern that they have a clear understanding of progress
+ identify improvements that could increase the chances of successful delivery
+ look at delivery activity across multiple teams, including governance, and assess how effective it is

Assurance should be:

+ proportionate to the service phase and scale
+ aligned to the [governance principles](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles) for digital services
+ based on mutual trust between the team and those involved in the assurance activities
+ open and transparent, with any observations or recommendations available to everyone

Assurers should actively seek feedback on their approach and adapt in response to that feedback.

###Assurers from within the organisation

Sometimes, assurance is provided by people elsewhere in the organisation. This could be a departmental audit team or specialists in particular disciplines (eg legal, technical, content, design).

Where more than one team is involved in developing a service, these assurers are useful because they can:

+ help ensure the service as a whole is healthy and set up for success
+ take part in coordination activities (eg [show and tells](/service-manual/governance/what-to-expect-from-the-show-and-tell) or stand up of stand ups --- where representatives of each team meet to talk about their upcoming work) to observe interactions and assure that cross-team dependencies, risks and opportunities are being managed properly
+ assess whether underspend is leading to problems with the service delivery or whether overspend means the service can still generate sufficient benefits
+ bring together the outcomes from assurance activities across the service to get a complete picture
+ look for common problems across the service or organisation and help ensure they are addressed
+ observe drift from an overall vision and goals that people who govern and individual teams might not notice

If assurers are involved with the service on an ongoing basis they can add more value than if they’re only involved periodically. They should engage early with the service manager and people who govern.


###Digital by Default Service Standard assessments

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is a set of criteria that has to be met by all new or redesigned transactional government services. 

Services with more than 100,000 transactions per year are assessed by the Government Digital Service (GDS). Services with under 100,000 transactions a year are [assessed by a team within their own department](/service-manual/digital-by-default/self-certification). 

Assessments happen at 3 points in the development of a service:

 + at the end of the alpha stage
 + when the service is ready to go to public beta on GOV.UK
 + at the end of beta when the service is ready to have its beta branding removed and be fully live

This is an assurance and approval process: if the GDS assessment panel doesn’t pass a service, it won’t be awarded the standard or appear on GOV.UK.

After an assessment, the panel provides feedback to the service team, including about where they might need to improve in order to meet the standard. Teams can use the criteria in the standard and the service manual to help focus and prioritise their work. If assurers from within the organisation are available, they can also use the service standard as a basis for their review activities.

###Cabinet Office spend controls

Under [Cabinet Office spend controls](/service-manual/technology/spending-controls) GDS assures all technology related spending over published thresholds. You should speak to GDS early on to agree appropriate points for approval and to get advice on shaping your expenditure request. 

###Major Projects Authority

The [Major Projects Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/major-projects-authority) (MPA)
 provides independent assurance on major projects, which are defined as those which:

+ need investment above a department’s expenditure limits
+ introduce new policy that requires primary legislation to be passed
+ are particularly innovative or contentious and may have higher delivery risk

The MPA assures projects through Gateway Reviews or Project Assessment Reviews. Gateway Reviews take place at significant points during a procurement process, whereas Project Assessment Reviews are bespoke, focussed and timed to meet the specific assurance needs of your service. 

###National Audit Office

The [National Audit Office](http://www.nao.org.uk/) (NAO) audits most public sector bodies in the UK and produces value for money reports on the implementation of government policies, which could include your service.

The NAO also publishes reports on good practice to help government improve public services. In recognition of the growing importance of [Agile delivery of digital services](/service-manual/agile/index), the NAO published a report in 2012 on [governance for Agile delivery](http://www.nao.org.uk/report/governance-for-agile-delivery-4/), drawing on experiences of governance in the private sector.
