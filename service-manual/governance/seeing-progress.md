###Getting a picture of where you are

To govern a service, you need to understand the work that‘s being done and how this work is organised by the teams.

To get a picture of where you are, you need to have a service vision, goals and a roadmap for realising that vision -- you’ll measure progress against these goals. Create your vision, goals and roadmap at the start and modify them as you learn more about user needs.

Good governance includes getting a clear view of progress without creating any extra work for the team. Delivery teams already produce the data you need to be able to provide governance support.

Delivery teams use walls to manage their work and track progress.

###Supporting delivery

Encourage communication and information sharing by creating a culture where people can be open. Listen to your delivery teams and look for opportunities to help meet their needs so that they can work together effectively.

Remember that:

+ the delivery team will have data and tracking techniques to measure progress -- these should be all you’ll need for good governance

+ focusing your efforts on things outside the team’s control and [unblocking delivery](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#dont-slow-down-delivery) means the team's time is spent on the most important things

+ the best way to understand where you are is to [go see things for yourself](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#go-see-for-yourself) -- face-to-face discussion is better than written reports

+ delivery team retrospectives can give valuable insight into recurring issues as well as giving a sense of how the team think they are doing

Visit the delivery team and try using what they’re producing, eg at the team’s [show and tell](/service-manual/governance/what-to-expect-from-the-show-and-tell). Look at prototypes and team walls to understand how the service will meet user needs.
