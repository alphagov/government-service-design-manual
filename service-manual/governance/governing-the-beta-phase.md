When you’re governing the beta phase of a service, you’ll need to consider:

* delivery and assurance

* funding and approvals

* the service delivery team

##Delivery and assurance

After a successful alpha, the service vision and goals will have evolved into something more concrete. You’ll have investigated risks and gained a more thorough understanding of your users and their needs.

**Review governance**

You should review the governance arrangements you’ll need for the beta service, bearing in mind that you may have multiple teams working towards a common set of objectives.

Keep your governance arrangements as lightweight as possible whilst still supporting development of the service.

**Plan for known risks**

A successful alpha will have investigated most of the areas of risk and uncertainty in your service. Use this to inform your roadmap and try to identify and plan for risks that are specific to beta.

Including risks in your roadmap will help you focus on the risks that are relevant to delivery.

**Measure progress**

The most important measures of progress are seeing the service being delivered and user satisfaction. The team wall is another useful way of seeing how delivery is progressing --- it’s essential everyone understands how the wall can help show progress.

Find out more about [how to decide what to measure](/service-manual/measurement/other-kpis#decide-what-to-measure).

**Keep going to show and tells**

This is where the team demonstrates progress by showing what they’ve been doing. It’s an opportunity to ensure user needs are being met.

The team may ask for help in unblocking something, or need a decision on something that needs your steer.

**Test benefits**

In beta you’ll be delivering a working, public facing version of the service. This phase is an opportunity to test expected benefits with users.

##Funding and approvals

**Review costs for beta and live**

Consider the expected lifetime of the service and costs for:

* people

* software

* technical infrastructure 

* team environment (facilities) and support

* continuous improvement

* [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital/)


As you progress in beta you should get a much clearer picture of live service costs.

**Revisit procurement needs**

As your understanding of what is needed for live service improves, you may discover, for example, that you need more people, different skills or changing cloud service requirements. Adjust your procurement accordingly.

**Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for beta and live**

Seek further approval for [funding your digital service](/service-manual/governance/funding-your-digital-service) as necessary.

**Digital by Default Service Standard assessment**

The Digital by [Default Service Standard (DbDSS)](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality.

This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing.

**Assurance and audit**

As you move through beta towards live, the typical assurance processes to get your business ready to run the live service are applicable.

There is a strong link to the DbDSS assessment at the beta to live point and it’s worth considering any additional assurance that may be beneficial beyond the scope of that assessment. 

This is likely to focus more on the business impact of introducing the new service, or new digital service channel, and any associated transition arrangements.

Any audit of beta should focus on the team and governance process and behaviour, not the actual decisions taken.

The team and its governance bodies can only be expected to make decisions based on what’s known at the time. A decision may be found to be wrong as better information becomes available, eg through testing with users. 

If your service development team is working well, it will quickly learn and modify its approach.

##Team

**Unblock and support the team**

Teams need help with things that slow them down and are outside of their control. During beta they’ll need you to be closely involved on a daily basis, so that you can help them with decisions, encouragement and ideas. You’ll need to anticipate problems and make decisions promptly to avoid slowing down delivery.

**Revisit the size and shape of the team**

You’ll probably need a larger team with a broader range of skills to help as you start building the beta service. You should consider if you need business analysis, product management, operations or programme delivery management skills.

Find out more about [beta team requirements](/service-manual/phases/beta#team-requirements).

**Scale as necessary**

Scaling to more than one team brings overheads. It’s important to start small and stay small unless you really need to get bigger. And if you do, plan for these overheads and you’ll get better results.

**Review the team environment**

As your team changes it’s important to revisit their needs. New skills may mean new tools, and new people will certainly mean more space and equipment. Remember to keep the service teams seated together so that they can work more closely.
