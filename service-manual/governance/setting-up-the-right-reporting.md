###Getting started

Set up reporting in the early [phases of service delivery](/service-manual/phases). Work with your service team to experiment and learn to see what works and what doesn’t just as you’d experiment and learn about the service during these early phases.

It’s best to start by erring on the side of too little reporting rather than too much -- you’ll quickly find out what you’re missing -- and to focus on visual and face-to-face reporting, using [team walls](/service-manual/governance/how-delivery-teams-manage-their-work) and [show and tells](/service-manual/governance/what-to-expect-from-the-show-and-tell). Remember to [only do it if it adds value](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#only-do-it-if-it-adds-value).

You should provide timely, constructive feedback to delivery teams on what they need -- this helps them to improve their reporting. Good reporting from teams will help you make decisions and give feedback [when it’s needed](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#decisions-when-theyre-needed-at-the-right-level).

Service teams should work with you to understand what reporting you need. Make sure any reporting is really necessary and don't impose too many requirements. If you do, it will be counter-productive because it means less time spent on delivery work. This is especially important as you transition between one phase and another -- you don’t want the team to lose momentum. 

Teams should set up reporting in a way that won’t cause any extra work. This includes:

+ visual management -- teams should use their walls to capture everything they need for delivery
+ face to face meetings, like the [stand-up](/service-manual/agile/features-of-agile#daily-stand-up) and [show and tell](/service-manual/governance/what-to-expect-from-the-show-and-tell)

This reporting should provide all the information that's needed for good governance.

Everyone should feel comfortable and welcome to [view a team wall](/service-manual/governance/how-delivery-teams-manage-their-work) at any point. This will support a culture of transparency in your organisation and make sure any problems can be discussed and solved openly.

###Consistency in reporting

Delivery teams need flexibility in how they work in order to be effective, but you might be working with a number of services, and some consistency in how delivery teams provide information can help you govern well.

Teams should:

+ use their walls to manage their day-to-day work
+ maintain a backlog and use a wall to track how it’s changing over time
+ track progress against goals and key performance indicators (KPIs)
+ hold regular show and tell meetings

Some consistency in reporting means you can more effectively: 

+ see progress
+ support delivery teams
+ make informed decisions 
+ communicate with the rest of your organisation (and the public) about the service

Don’t try and force more consistency than this because the circumstances of each team will be so different.
