Assurance is built into [Agile ways of working](/service-manual/agile/index) with regular checkpoints and opportunities for feedback during service development. This means that assurance is proactive, ongoing and helps keep the service on track. The [governance principles](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles) for digital services outline how to keep governance work on track in a similar way.

A [phase based approach](/service-manual/governance/governance-across-the-life-of-a-service) to service development helps to increase the chances of success with in built assurance throughout each stage. Assurance should support delivery ([only do something if it adds value](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#only-do-it-if-it-adds-value)) and be proportionate to each phase.

###How Agile approaches reduce risk

Agile, user centred delivery is incremental, with delivery occurring every few weeks. In the early phases, you’ll be creating prototypes, and you’ll be delivering a live service for testing in the later phases. Regular delivery means that:

+ you can test what you’ve produced to see how well it’s meeting user needs --- this is the best form of assurance

+ there are regular opportunities to adjust or stop the work as you progress and as the results of testing become known 

[Visual management](/service-manual/governance/how-delivery-teams-manage-their-work) is built into Agile approaches. This supports ongoing assurance because progress is visible to anyone. It also means that:

+ a culture of trust develops through transparency
+ problems are less likely to be hidden
+ blockers and dependencies are easy to see

People who govern need to [go and see things for themselves](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#go-see-for-yourself) to judge progress. Doing this regularly is part of assurance --- it ensures there won’t be any surprises. This is the best way to understand how user needs are being met and to be reassured that delivery will be successful.

###How a phase based approach reduces risk

At the beginning of a service delivery, you have most to learn. Using a phase based delivery approach significantly reduces risk because:

+ early phases are about experimenting, learning and prototyping to decrease uncertainty about what to build and how to build it

+ there’s an early and continuous focus on meeting user needs --- this makes sure the right thing gets built

+ an early focus on investigating major risks and dependencies reduces the chances of them later affecting delivery

+ early phases have bounded time and cost but variable scope --- this forces everyone to focus on the most important areas to be investigated 

+ there are opportunities to try out different assurance, reporting and governance approaches and team composition to see what works and what doesn’t before things scale up --- this helps set the project up for success

It’s also important to assure governance as well as development, particularly early in the life of the service --- this is where the pattern of governance is formed and it’s vital to get it right.

###Agile processes for assurance

Agile approaches have a set of processes and ‘assets’ (eg data produced by teams, daily stand up meetings, walls displaying information). You can use these for assurance --- there’s no need to ask for anything in addition to this --- this just creates extra work and doesn’t add value.

When using Agile methods, planning happens:

+ daily (for the coming day)
+ every few weeks within a phase (for the next few weeks)
+ at the end of each phase (for the next phase)

This regular planning gives assurance that:

+ there’s consensus around user needs, goals and priorities
+ you’re focusing on the most valuable things to meet user needs and satisfy goals
+ you have the people and resources you need to do the work
+ risks, blockers and dependencies are being managed
+ teams are continually improving how they do their work

Regular [show and tells](/service-manual/governance/what-to-expect-from-the-show-and-tell) allow delivery teams to demonstrate their progress. They also allow people who govern to [go and see what's being delivered](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#go-see-for-yourself) for themselves. This is another useful form of assurance because they can:

+ form an opinion of whether the work is likely to be successful
+ see progress towards meeting user needs 
+ understand the things blocking the team

Assurers can also see governance in action at show and tells and so assess its effectiveness.

Other Agile processes useful for assurance are:

+ [retrospectives](/service-manual/agile/running-retrospectives) --- to understand what the team thinks is and isn’t going well (this helps continuous improvement of how the team works)
+ daily stand ups --- for making sure that people are doing the right things, working well together and communicating

###Assurance at scale

When there are multiple teams working on a service --- or a set of related services --- Agile ways of working support assurance. Activities like cross-team show and tells and the ‘stand up of stand ups’ help multiple teams communicate to make sure dependencies, risks and opportunities are being managed.
