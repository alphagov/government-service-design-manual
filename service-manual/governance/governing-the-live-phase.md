When you’re governing the live phase of a service, you’ll need to consider:

* delivery and assurance

* funding and approvals

* the service delivery team

##Delivery and assurance

**Revisit your vision and refine your roadmap**

The service vision and roadmap will be stable and certain as you go into live service as you’ll have used the previous phases to thoroughly understand user needs. 

Any changes to the service should be based on emerging user needs and operating context (eg legislative or technological changes, espionage or criminal threats to the service). A service being continually improved is a condition of a service being on GOV.UK.

**Review your governance arrangements**

You should review what governance arrangements you’ll need for the live service, bearing in mind this covers both running the live service and improving the service.

**Plan for known risks**

By the time you’re running a live service, most of your delivery risks will have been dealt with in earlier phases. However, it’s important to understand what risks can affect the success of your service and the benefits it’s expected to deliver.

**Continue to work in an agile way**

You should continue to run show and tells to provide opportunities to demonstrate new and changed features. The team may ask for help in unblocking something or a decision on something that needs your steer.

Retrospectives still provide valuable opportunities for reflection, learning and improvement in live operation. They might focus on the service operation in the broadest sense or specific activities like introducing new or improved features.

If you have more than one service, you could look at ways of having larger retrospectives where the services share how they are working, what’s working well for them and what isn’t.

**Review benefits**

You should now be getting the benefits you expected. You’ll have a service dashboard on the [performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance) which will show actual take-up of the digital service. You can compare its figures against those you predicted in the business case and find out if you are on track or not.

You should also be:

* reviewing actual cost savings (eg less support calls, reduced administrative time spent on processing transactions) and deciding when to realise these by scaling back operations

* checking your assumptions about assisted digital and finding out whether its users are the expected demographic

* decommissioning obsolete systems

**Funding and approvals**

The business case for the service should cover development plus the first 2 years of live operation, including continuous iterative improvement. 

Beyond this, you need to consider the budget demands for the live service as part of the department’s usual budgetary process. The funding should cover ongoing improvement and any minor changes needed to remain compliant with legislation.

If the service needs a major overhaul, you should treat this as a new service development and start again with discovery.

**Revisit procurement needs**

Identify any external resource needs for live operation and ensure that investment and spend control approvals are secured to enable procurement activity to progress.

The Government Digital Strategy aims to build in-house capability, so the need to procure external capability should reduce over time.

**Assurance and audit**

Part of assurance is reviewing whether or not expected benefits are being realised. You can use your department’s internal audit team to run reviews and the Major Projects Authority (MPA) will assure major projects.

The National Audit Office audits most public-sector bodies in the UK and produces value for money reports into the implementation of government policies, so you may find that it does this for your service.

##Team

**Revisit the size and shape of the team**

During live service operation your team may need to change size and shape in response to user needs and operating context. Teams will expand and contract over the service lifetime.

**Ensure the team has skills necessary to run the live service**

It’s important the live service continues to improve.

If you need to introduce new team members, you should manage this sensitively and gradually, in a way that allows them to gain confidence that they have the skills to continue development of the service.

**Review the team environment**

As your team changes it’s important to revisit their needs.

**Support the team**

You will need to remain involved so that you can help the team with decisions, encouragement, ideas and feedback.
