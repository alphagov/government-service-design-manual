###Scaling a service team

It’s natural for team size and composition to increase and decrease over the life of a service as the amount and type of work changes. The process of increasing or decreasing team size is known as ‘scaling’.

###Scaling during the life of a service

Delivery of digital services is best achieved through a [small multidisciplinary team](/service-manual/the-team) using an [agile](/service-manual/agile/index) approach.

However, you should recognise that you may need to scale up or down to meet your goals as you move through the [phases in the life of the service](/service-manual/governance/governance-across-the-life-of-a-service).

###How a team might scale during the life of a service

Every service will have different needs over its lifetime. Typically during discovery and alpha you’ll need a small team to experiment, try stuff out and solve the harder potential problems on the project.

Moving to beta and live, the team will be delivering a set of capabilities iteratively with regular user testing. You often need to scale up during beta, and sometimes in live when a change is big. You should only scale up when you already have a well-formed team delivering consistently.

Scale according to service needs, instead of trying to scale across the entire organisation. This will mean you [increase capacity only when you absolutely need to](/service-manual/governance/when-to-scale-up).

You can scale up by adding people to existing teams or by creating new ones. It’s better to increase the size of existing teams until it becomes impractical. If this happens, consider adding more teams.

Scale incrementally instead of resourcing to peak capacity from an early stage. New [business case arrangements](/service-manual/governance/funding-your-digital-service) and use of [procurement frameworks](http://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm1043) allow you to build your team as the work requires.

It’s easy to forget about reducing teams and team size to match the work throughout the life of your service. When a service moves from beta to live, more user needs will have been met and there’s typically less remaining work. Whilst you must continuously, iteratively improve your service over time, you won’t always need the same size of team as you did during peak development, so think about how and when to scale down.

You’ll need to plan to scale down carefully. Review the service roadmap, release plans and product backlog with your team to determine when and how to scale down. Consider whether it’s sensible to merge teams. Bear in mind that remaining team members will need time to reorganise their work.
