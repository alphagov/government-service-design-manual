When you’re governing the alpha phase of a service, you’ll need to consider:

* delivery and assurance

* funding and approvals

* the service delivery team

##Delivery and assurance

**Revisit your vision and goals**

The service vision will probably have evolved as you learned more during discovery. Even if it hasn’t changed, it’s important to revisit it in this phase as your team is likely to change or expand. 

Doing this helps ensure everyone understands:

* what the service is

* why it’s important

* who it’s important to

**Review your governance arrangements**

Your team may take on a different shape as you start to build a prototype. As the team and goals change, make sure your governance team is still closely involved in supporting the team delivering the service.

**Identify and mitigate risks**

A crucial outcome of the alpha phase is that the team can identify the biggest risks to the service early on. Things that may help manage risks include using iterations to test incrementally and adding critical risks to the team wall.

Find out more about [identifying risks during alpha](/service-manual/phases/ideal-alphas#identifying-risks).

**Create a roadmap based on the outcome of your discovery**

We use roadmaps to describe the high level direction a service will take. Roadmaps need a firm vision with goals that are focused on outcomes. 

It’s important to establish goals during discovery and create the roadmap with the team. The roadmap will inform the business case.

Your roadmap may identify that the service is broken up into a number of segments, each of which have their own beta phase and then get separately put into live service.

Find out more about [identifying goals during alpha](/service-manual/phases/ideal-alphas#identifying-goals).

**Measure your progress**

You should use the measures you agreed to use during discovery. If you decide to measure progress in a different way, you need to make sure this is really necessary and get everyone involved in the decision to change.

The team wall is an important tool -  it’s essential everyone understands how the wall can help show progress.

**Go to show and tells**

This is where the team demonstrates progress by showing what they’ve been doing. It’s an opportunity to ensure user needs are being met. 

The team may ask for help in unblocking something, or need a decision on something that needs your steer.

**Clarify benefits**

By testing prototypes with users you will verify whether or not the expected benefits can be realised.

Some examples of benefits from digital services include:

* making it easier and quicker for users to register for and use a service 

* reduction of print and post costs

* more accurate user data

* cost reduction through labour saving

##Funding and approvals

**Identify costs for beta and live**

Consider the expected lifetime of the service and costs for:

* people

* software

* technical infrastructure 

* team environment (facilities) and support

* continuous improvement

* [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital/)

**Revisit procurement needs**

You need to evaluate the size of team you need for beta and get costs for things like cloud services and tools needed for development so you can build a set of costs for spend approval and the business case.
Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs, as can actual spend data of similar services.

**Develop your business case and get approval**

If you haven’t already appointed a senior responsible officer (SRO), should appoint one now to sponsor the business case. This could be the service manager or someone else senior in the business.

Seek [funding for your digital service](/service-manual/governance/funding-your-digital-service) with a business case for further investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approvals. You can’t start beta until you have an approved business case.

**Digital by default service standard assessment**

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality. 

This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing.

**Plan for assurance and audit**

In addition to the in-built assurance activities at the team level (eg pairing, show and tells, user research and retrospectives), you can use your department’s internal audit team to provide an independent view.

A valuable side-effect of this assurance can be identifying potential opportunities and dependencies with other departmental initiatives that could impact your service development.

If your development is, or is part of, a [major project](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/major-projects-authority) then you’ll have developed an [Integrated Approval and Assurance Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61374/MPA_20Guidance.pdf) that defines appropriate assurance activities.

In these circumstances you’d also expect to have a [Major Projects Authority (MPA) Project Assessment Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61378/MPA_20PAR_20guidance_20for_20Departments.pdf) towards the end of alpha to help the shaping of beta and the development and approval of your business case.

Even if you’re not subject to MPA assurance, you should plan the assurance and approvals points in your service roadmap, clearly identifying who needs to be involved, in what role and when.
Any audit of alpha should focus on the team and governance process and behaviour, not the actual decisions taken.

The team and its governance bodies can only be expected to make decisions based on what’s known at the time. A decision may be found to be wrong as better information becomes available, eg through testing with users. 

If your service development team is working well, it will quickly learn and modify its approach.

##Team

**Unblock and support the team**

Teams need help with things that slow them down and are outside of their control. During alpha they’ll need you to be closely involved on a daily basis, so that you can help them with decisions, encouragement and ideas.

You’ll need to anticipate problems and make decisions promptly to avoid slowing down delivery and ensure a seamless transition from the alpha to beta phase.

**Revisit the size and shape of the team**

You’ll probably need more user researchers, developers and designers to help deliver your alpha, particularly as you start building prototypes of the service.

You may also need finance people, economists and analysts to help with your business case.

During alpha you’ll also need to work out [the team](/service-manual/the-team/index) structure and composition you need for beta and beyond. 

**Consider if you need to scale**

At this point your team may need to think about adding more people and how that will affect delivery.

**Review team needs**

As your team changes, it’s important to revisit their needs. New skills may mean new tools, and new people will certainly mean more space and equipment. Remember to keep the service team seated together so that they can work closely.
