There are [5 phases of service delivery](/service-manual/phases) --- discovery, alpha, beta, live and retirement. You’ll need to get approval at different phases when you build your service. 

##Discovery and alpha

[Discovery](/service-manual/phases/discovery) is right at the start of your project --- where you research user needs, find out about any policy or technological constraints and get a picture of what your first prototypes will explore.

During the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha), you start building and testing those prototypes.

To start discovery, you need approval for discovery and alpha. This means:

* investment approval from your department

* [Cabinet Office spend control approval](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-32) to spend on external resources, eg on suppliers

You don’t normally need a detailed business case for discovery and alpha because they inform the development of the bigger investment case for beta and live.

As a guide, discovery and alpha together shouldn’t cost over £750,000. If you plan to go above this, you should question whether you’ve sized the discovery and alpha correctly --- if you do exceed this figure you’ll need a detailed business case.


##Beta and live

The beta phase is where you build a fully working prototype that you’ll test in public. The live phase is when your public beta has been tested and is ready to release.

To go to beta you’ll need approval for beta and live. This means:

* investment approval from your department

* [Cabinet Office spend control approval](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-32) to spend on external resources, eg on suppliers

* any other approvals specific to your service eg headcount or salary/grade changes

You need to submit a business case to HM Treasury ([HM Treasury published guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-governent)) if any of following apply:

* your anticipated total spend on the entire programme (including non-digital aspects) is higher than your organisation’s delegated authority as set by HM Treasury

* your digital spend is above £10 million

If you need to approach HM Treasury and your digital spend is below £10 million, just include it concisely within your programme business case rather than writing a separate business case for it.

##Managing business cases for digital services

HM Treasury has introduced the ‘programme business case’, where detail can be added by phase. This is because agile delivery:

* typically enables smaller, more frequent funding approvals

* may form part of a larger programme of transformational change

The programme business case can be used for projects or programmes that have agile delivery elements. It replaces the traditional approval process (strategic outline case followed by outline business case and full business case).

However, these still apply for large investment decisions involving lengthy public sector OJEU (Official Journal of the European Union) procurement processes. 

There’s more information about this in the [HM Treasury clarification on business cases for agile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-governent/agile-systems-projects-a-clarification-of-business-case-guidance).
