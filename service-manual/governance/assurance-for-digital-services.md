Assurance is a range of activities and processes put in place to make sure services meet user needs and organisational goals. It’s important because it helps successful delivery of services by improving people's understanding of progress, helping them make informed decisions about the work being done.

Assurance is an ongoing process that helps maintain quality through the life of a service.

###Who’s involved in assurance

Everyone working on a service has responsibility for assurance. It’s built in to [Agile ways of working](/service-manual/agile/index) with regular checkpoints and opportunities for feedback that help keep governance and delivery work on track. This [self assurance](/service-manual/governance/self-assurance-by-agile-teams) gives teams the opportunity to:

+ review each others’ work
+ challenge and refine ways of working through transparent communications
+ reflect on how the service could be improved in the light of feedback

This way of working helps assure the quality of the services being delivered and provides reassurance to those responsible for governance, helping to [build trust](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#trust-and-verify).

Sometimes, services benefit from an independent view provided by someone not directly involved in day-to-day delivery. This provides extra confidence that everyone is seeing a clear picture of progress. It can also be useful where there are multiple teams with interdependencies or higher levels of investment, complexity and risk associated with the service. 

External assurance could be done by:

+ departmental assurance teams
+ specialist reviewers, eg technical, legal, content, design 
+ the Major Projects Authority --- mandatory for certain projects
+ the Government Digital Service (GDS) --- via [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) assessments (mandatory for services with more than 100,000 transactions per year)

###How assurance is done

Assurance should be done in line with the governance principles for digital services:

+ [don’t slow down delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#dont-slow-down-delivery) --- assurers need to work at the same pace as delivery teams, using the data teams are already producing to manage delivery

+ [decisions when they’re needed, at the right level](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#decisions-when-theyre-needed-at-the-right-level) --- assurers should have the authority to make decisions and provide recommendations to solve problems before they affect delivery

+ [do it with the right people](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#do-it-with-the-right-people) --- assurers need recognised skills and experience in what they’re assuring so they can be effective and credible

+ [go see for yourself](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#go-see-for-yourself) --- face-to-face communication with delivery teams and people who govern is the most effective way of assuring

+ [only do it if it adds value](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#only-do-it-if-it-adds-value) --- assurance should be focused where it can add the most value and this will be different for each service

+ [trust and verify](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#trust-and-verify) --- mutual trust between assurers and those they assure is vital
