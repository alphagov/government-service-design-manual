Discovery is more successful when you begin by:
 
* describing the initial vision for the service

* assigning a service manager

* assembling a discovery team

* agreeing the outcomes you want from discovery

You need to get investment approval within your department and spend approval from Cabinet Office if you’re going to spend money on a supplier. 

If your service is in response to a new policy, make sure you consider the digital service during the policy impact assessment. 

You need to set up proportionate governance for discovery -- you’ll need to consider:

* delivery and assurance

* funding and approvals

* the service delivery team

Governance during the discovery phase will include a small team of senior people acting as sponsors and advisors. They’ll be closely involved with the delivery team exploring the service needs during discovery.

##Delivery and assurance

**Plan for your discovery**

Before discovery, you need to plan and gather sufficient information to make sure what you’re doing fits with the wider organisational strategy. 

You need to:

* develop a service vision laying out the overall intention of the service, including who the users are and why the service is important 

* agree a handful of discovery goals and how to measure progress

* find out who the stakeholders are

* set up initial governance and communicate what people can expect from it

Goals and measures are likely to be incomplete and there may be little evidence on which to base targets. Your service vision will probably evolve too.

**Go to show and tells**

‘Seeing the thing’ at show and tells is an important governance activity -- this is useful because:

* the team can demonstrate progress towards meeting discovery goals

* you can see how the well they are working together

* you can support and help unblock things that are slowing them down

Even early in the life of a service, there’s a lot that the team can show to demonstrate the outcomes of their work.

**Identify benefits**

In discovery you’ll spend some time exploring and understanding what benefits the service could bring to users and government. You’ll do this through lots of user research and a close analysis of policies, laws and business needs. 

If you don’t identify benefits from the start, the chances of them being realised are reduced. Different delivery options may offer different benefits -- so identify the options in discovery and explore further during alpha.

##Funding and approvals

**Identify costs for discovery and alpha**

Consider the costs for:

* people

* software

* infrastructure

* team environment and facilities

You’ll probably need to bring in additional skills at different points. You’ll also need:

* design and development tools

* a user research lab (possibly) 

* a large stock of whiteboards, sticky notes and pens

Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs.

**Evolve the service vision**

The service vision should state:

* what the service is and who it is for

* key benefits it provides

* how success will be measured 

* how it fits in with organisational strategy

It may also contain known risks and constraints.

**Get approval**

Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for discovery and alpha. There’s more information about this in the guidance on [funding your digital service](/service-manual/governance/funding-your-digital-service).

**Consider procurement needs**

Involve procurement and HR during discovery to ensure there is no lag between discovery and alpha. They’ll help you secure the resources and people needed.

**Make a decision to proceed or not**

Discovery has 4 possible outcomes -- you can decide to:

* stop

* extend discovery (if you haven’t found out enough yet)

* restart discovery (if you need to investigate something completely different)

* proceed to alpha

You should use [the outputs from discovery](/service-manual/phases/discovery#outputs) to help you decide. You can make the decision to stop at any point during discovery.

##Team

**Set up your discovery team**

You’ll need a small [team](/service-manual/the-team/) consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager) and potentially policy, procurement, HR and legal as required.

**Equip the discovery team properly**

Make sure people have a [good working environment](/service-manual/the-team/working-environment) and the tools they need.
