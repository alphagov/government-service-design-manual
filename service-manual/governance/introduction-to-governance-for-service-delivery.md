###What governance is and why we need it

Governance enables service delivery by creating the right conditions to ensure that delivery teams can do the right things for users -- in the right way and at the right time. This means:

* making sure we’re doing things that meet user needs and achieve organisational goals

* being aligned to organisational standards and ways of working

* deciding what to deliver when and prioritising things

* anticipating problems and making decisions to avoid slowing down delivery

The guidance in this section of the manual is about how to do this. It provides advice on the governance practices needed across:

* multiple teams

* broader programmes of work

* team level activities

Delivery teams need support from people who govern so they can build services that meet user needs.

###Who’s involved in governance

Everyone who’s working to deliver a service is in some way responsible for and involved in its governance.

At the team level, agile processes (eg daily stand-ups, regular planning meetings and retrospectives) are all forms of governing delivery. They help make sure that the right things are done in the right way at the right time.

This guidance applies to service managers, senior responsible officers, auditors and assurers, and to senior people (eg digital leaders and chief digital officers). These people who govern are responsible for creating the right conditions for a service to be successful.

The guidance is also useful for any other people in service teams so they know what to expect from governance activity.

###Governance principles

GDS has defined [6 principles for governing service development](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles). Following them should help you create the right culture within your service development environment. They are:

1. [Don’t slow down delivery](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#dont-slow-down-delivery)

2. [Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#decisions-when-theyre-needed-at-the-right-level)

3. [Do it with the right people](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#do-it-with-the-right-people)

4. [Go see for yourself](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#go-see-for-yourself)

5. [Only do it if it adds value](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#only-do-it-if-it-adds-value)

6. [Trust and verify](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles#trust-and-verify)

###How to govern

This section of the service manual provides guidance on [how to govern across the life of a service](/service-manual/governance/governance-across-the-life-of-a-service) with advice for each phase including:

* managing approvals and funding your digital service

* supporting delivery and managing assurance

* supporting your team

* how to scale up
