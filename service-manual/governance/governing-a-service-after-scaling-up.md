###Governing more than one team

When scaling your team make sure you continue to follow the [GDS governance principles](/service-manual/governance/governance-principles) to keep governance to a minimum.

As soon as you have more than one team you’ll need shared planning, coordination and management of dependencies. This can mean a small increase in the amount of work, but don't lose sight of the aim to have self organising, self managed teams.

Scaling up doesn’t mean you need to add more people who govern; don’t complicate governance processes as you scale. You need to:

* make sure everyone understands the service vision and goals --- especially new starters

* have teams plan together and think about what they’ll individually be responsible for

* where possible look at splitting work by theme, product or feature sets to minimise dependencies between teams

* think about whether it makes sense to share specialist people across teams, eg software architects and people working in security, policy or finance

###Get your teams working together

It’s better for multiple teams to be sitting in the same location --- just as a single team benefits from this. When your teams don’t sit together:

* there are communication overheads

* there’s less informal communication and learning

* it’s harder to establish a shared culture

This is particularly problematic when ‘business’ and delivery team members don’t sit together. If you can’t find a suitable shared space or team members live and work in different parts of the country, split the team. There are ways to minimise the problems separation causes, eg:

* video communication

* social media

* regular face-to-face meetings

You can also get team representatives together in a cross team stand up (sometimes called a ‘stand up of stand ups'), where the following questions are explored:

* what has your team done since we last met?

* what will your team do before we meet again?

* is anything slowing your team down or getting in their way?

* are you about to do something that will affect another team's plans?

The last question helps teams to gain early sight of any dependencies or cross team issues that will need joint remedy. The frequency of these meetings is best determined by the teams and the pace of delivery.

###Plan for scaling

It’s important to plan for changes in team composition. Planning activities include: 

* consulting with the delivery team on who should be added when

* making sure the team can devote time to integrating new people

* making sure new people will have the tools they need to be productive on the day they arrive

When you have more teams, don’t force them to work in exactly the same way as each other. Delivery teams work best when they can control how they work.
