You should only consider scaling up when everyone is already working well together. Adding more people, particularly when done quickly, is likely to magnify any problems if the team isn’t working well.

Your team should tell you when it thinks scaling up is a good option.

You may need to scale up if:

* there’s too much work for the team

* your current pace means you won’t meet delivery commitments

* the team is too big or too far apart to work together effectively

###There’s too much work for the team

This might be the case if:

* the backlog isn’t reducing in size despite steady progress

* you’re finding it difficult to prioritise, plan and manage dependencies between things

* the team’s delivery manager has too much work

Where there are obvious pieces of work in the backlog that would sustain another team it can make sense to scale up and split the backlog into themes for multiple teams to work on in parallel.

Before scaling up, check that the backlog is really as big as you think --- is everything in it necessary by a fixed date?

###The current pace means you won’t meet a delivery date

Delivery teams should track their progress to forecast when they will complete work. If forecasts show that delivery will happen after a deadline, you may be able to scale up to meet your delivery date.

###The team is too big or too far apart to work together effectively

As a team grows, it may become too big to work as effectively as 2 smaller teams would. This can have a negative impact on the culture and behaviours of people working in the team --- so it could be better to split into smaller teams.

Your team might be too big if:

* the daily stand-up is lasting more than 15 minutes

* team members’ updates are not relevant to everyone

* you start to see smaller stand-ups happening organically after the main stand-up so people who are working together can plan better 

It might also make sense to split a big team when different features of your service require different balances of skills to develop. Teams working on particular features should remain multidisciplinary. Having smaller teams in this situation simplifies communication.

###Things to think about

Adding more people will slow delivery initially. Be prepared for a drop in productivity while new people are brought up to speed and integrated into the team. If you add too many people, it could eventually lead to a permanent slowing down of the team due to communication and coordination overheads.

When scaling up there's also a risk that you could lose your delivery focused culture. Try to ‘seed’ new teams with existing team members to provide continuity in culture, knowledge and expertise.

**Seed new teams with existing team members**

Only add more people when you are confident that they are a good cultural fit and have the right skills and experience. Don’t attempt to make do - if you can’t get the right people available to work on the service, adjust your scope or delivery deadlines instead.
