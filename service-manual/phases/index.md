  <p>Building a digital service is a complex task, with many risks. By breaking development into phases you minimise risk, learning about what works and what doesn't, iterating as you go.</p>

  <p>As the service progresses through development you'll find out more about users' needs, development requirements and the conditions your service will be operating in. The level of detail, complexity and risk will increase along the way.</p>

  <p>This approach allows the team making and operating the service to start small, learn fast, and provide value to users as soon as possible.</p>
