{:.intro}
When designing a service it is impossible to predict everything up-front. Each project features many challenges, and in your alpha you will start exploring solutions for these.

You may need to bring more [developers](/service-manual/the-team/developer.html) and [designers](/service-manual/the-team/designer.html) into [the team](/service-manual/the-team), who will help you to build and test [prototypes](/service-manual/design-and-content/working-with-prototypes.html) and possible solutions for you [users needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html).

By the end of the alpha you should have a clear idea of what's required to build a [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html). The whole phase should not last longer than about six to eight weeks.

## What is the objective of an alpha?

The objective is to build a working prototype. This will be used by stakeholders or a closed group of end users to:

* gain greater understanding of a service
* to trial [design approach](/service-manual/design-and-content/working-with-prototypes.html)
* trial some [technologies](/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html)
* begin to form [the team](/service-manual/the-team)
* gain shared understanding of the service at a coding and integrations level
* understand what or who you will need to deliver a [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html)

Continue to build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs and use this to set up an open, engagement process with your stakeholders. Try to involve a wide range of stakeholders from the private, voluntary and other parts of the public sector. Consider running a series of workshops with these stakeholders to develop your options.

Following demonstration of your alpha, you may choose to discard the code and start fresh in the [beta](/service-manual/phases/beta.html). If, however, your code is robust enough you may continue to iterate against your prototype.

## What should be in my alpha?

The alpha doesn't need to be a complete, end-to-end transaction. You're looking to demonstrate just enough so users gain some understanding of the service.

Think of it as a proof-of-concept. Is the solution appropriate? Is your approach viable? Do you have enough understanding of your users' needs to meet them? If not, find out more and make a new prototype.

## How long does it take?
The alpha phase is another relatively short phase. At GDS, we try to limit these to about two months, running in week long sprints over a 6-9 week period.

## Who do I need?
This phase involves a relatively small core team, who will be capable of rapidly iterating solutions. It will probably expand and contract in size as different specialisms are required.

## What are the outputs?

* high level [story cards](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html)
* plan for alpha / beta / live (decreasingly detailed)
* working basic system that provides limited functionality that can be shown to a number of users
* understanding around legacy systems to replace or wrap or integrate with
* cross-functional requirements
* decision to progress to [beta phase](/service-manual/phases/beta.html)
* build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs
* contact GDS about the content of your assisted digital provision
