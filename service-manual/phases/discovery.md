{:.intro}
The discovery phase is your chance to find out what the users of your service need, what the business requirements are and what technological or policy related constraints there might be.

The discovery phase is your chance to gain an understanding of what the users of the service need, what the business requirements are and what technological or policy related constraints there might be. This is achieved through [research, workshops and interviews](/service-manual/users/introduction-to-user-research.html).

## Objectives

<figure class="media-player-wrapper video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVX1BT0oxWU">Watch Aleks Maricic, GDS Proposition Manager, describe the discovery phase.</a></figure>

The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of users needs, what the existing service landscape looks like and a sense of what your initial prototypes will explore.

The high level business context will become clear, and you will begin setting targets for [your KPIs](/service-manual/measurement).

You will also get a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing process are in place for replacing or decommissioning these.

This information is found through:

* workshops
* simple mock ups
* paper prototypes
* plenty of whiteboard diagrams

## The team

[A small team will be required](/service-manual/the-team), consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html).


# Timescales

The phase should not take longer than 4-8 weeks. During the final week you should be setting up the broad scope of a  project and an initial backlog to deliver against. This is known as an 'inception'. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html).


## Outputs

You will leave the discovery phase with:

* a prioritised list of [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html)
* a prioritised list of [story cards](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) to feed into project teams
* understanding of landscape
* understanding of [team](/service-manual/the-team) and capability required to deliver the project
* ability to scope and plan an [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html)
* a decision to progress to next phase
* maybe some rough prototypes
