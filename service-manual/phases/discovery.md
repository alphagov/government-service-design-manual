{:.intro}
What are the [needs of your users](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html)? What services currently meet those? How are they [performing](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform)? What technological or policy related constraints might there be?

Before you start building a service you need to build up a picture of what the context for that service is. That means lots of [user research](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/index.html), close analysis of policies, laws and business needs, and workshops and interviews which establish the criteria for success of your service.

## Objectives

<figure class="media-player-wrapper video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVX1BT0oxWU">Watch Aleks Maricic, GDS Proposition Manager, describe the discovery phase.</a></figure>

The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html), what the existing service landscape looks like and a sense of what your [initial prototypes](/service-manual/user-centred-design/working-with-prototypes.html) will explore.

You'll need to think about user needs for digital and assisted digital users. As a start, you'll need to understand [what proportion of your users you think will need assisted digital support](/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html#discovery-stage).

The high-level business context will become clear, and you'll begin setting targets for [your KPIs](/service-manual/measurement).

You'll also get a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing processes are in place for [replacing or decommissioning these](/service-manual/phases/retirement.html).

This information is found through:

* workshops
* simple mock ups
* paper prototypes
* plenty of whiteboard diagrams

## The team

[A small team will be required](/service-manual/the-team), consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html).


# Timescales

The phase should not take longer than 4 to 8 weeks. During the final week you should be setting up the broad scope of a project and an initial set of [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) (also known as a backlog) to work to. This is known as an 'inception'. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html).


## Outputs

You will leave the discovery phase with:

* a prioritised list of [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html)
* a prioritised list of [story cards](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) to feed into project teams
* an understanding of the [team](/service-manual/the-team) and the capabilities required to complete the project
* the ability to scope and plan an [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html)
* a decision to progress to next phase
* maybe some rough prototypes
* maybe some user personas
* a list of stakeholders and input from them about existing services
* understanding of existing services, including those run by non-government sources
* understanding of how many of your users will need assisted digital support, and what their user needs are
