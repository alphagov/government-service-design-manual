The discovery phase is your chance to gain an understanding of what the users of the service need, what the business requirements are and what technological or policy related constraints there might be. This is achieved through [research, workshops and interviews](/service-manual/users/introduction-to-user-research.html). 

Typical outputs from this phase are a list of [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html), high level wireframes or prototypes and possibly user personas. It's a very short phase, probably taking no more than a week.

## What is the objective of a discovery process?

The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of users needs, what the existing service landscape looks like and a sense of what your initial protoypes will explore.

The high level business context will become clear, and you will begin setting targets for [your KPIs](/service-manual/measurement).

You will also get a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing process are in place for replacing or decomissioning these.

This information is found through:

* workshops
* simple mock ups
* paper prototypes 
* plenty of whiteboard diagrams

## How long does it take and who should be part of it?

[A small team will be required](/service-manual/the-team), consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html). The phase should not take longer than a week. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html).

## What are the outputs?

You will leave the discovery phase with:

* a prioritised list of [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html)
* a prioritised list of [story cards](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) to feed into project teams
* understanding of landscape
* understanding of [team](/service-manual/the-team) and capability required to deliver the project
* ability to scope and plan an [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html)
* a decision to progress to next phase
* maybe some rough prototypes
