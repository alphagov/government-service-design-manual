You've tested your solutions to [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html) and built up a clear picture of what it will take to [build](/service-manual/making-software) and [operate](/service-manual/operations) your service. Now you will build an end-to-end prototype, test it in public and prepare to run it.

## What is the objective of a beta?

The objective of this phase is to build a fully working prototype which you test publicly with users. You will continuously improve on the prototype until it is ready to go live, replacing or integrating with any existing services.

This is achieved by delivering the [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) in the backlog created in the [alpha phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html). This is the time to resolve any outstanding technical or process-related challenges, get the service [accredited](/service-manual/making-software/information-security.html) and plan to go live.

You will also be resolving technical and process challenges, meeting for the first time many of the technical criteria outlined in the [service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default). You should be [rapidly releasing](/service-manual/making-software/release-strategies.html) updates and improvements into the [development environment](/service-manual/making-software/development-environment.html), and [measuring the impact](/service-manual/measurement) of your changes to the KPIs established in your [discovery](/service-manual/phases/discovery.html) and [alpha](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html) phases.

## How long does it take?

The exact duration of your beta will depend on the scope of your project, but an appropriately sized team shouldn't take more than a few months to deliver a public beta.

Following the release of your beta you will spend some time iterating on the service until it is ready to go [live](/service-manual/phases/live.html).

## Who do I need?

You will now know [what size team](/service-manual/the-team) you need to deliver the service, scoping it in response to the findings of your [alpha prototype(s)](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html). It will be run by a single, suitably skilled [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html), and will include [designers](/service-manual/the-team/designer.html), [developers](/service-manual/the-team/developer.html), [web operations](/service-manual/the-team/web-operations.html) specialists and performance analysts as appropriate.


## What are the outputs?
You will have:

* delivered a public, end-to-end prototype of the service
* high level story cards
* a [user testing plan](/service-manual/users/introduction-to-user-research.html)
* [accurate metrics and measurements](/service-manual/measurement) to monitor your KPIs
* a working system that can be used, for real, by end users
