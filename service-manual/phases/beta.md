The objective of this phase is to build a fully working prototype and make it available to all end users.

This is achieved by delivering the user stories in the backlog created in the Alpha phase. This is the time to resolve any outstanding technical or process-related challenges, get the service accredited and plan to go live.

You will now know what size team you need to deliver the service. The Beta phase should typically take a couple of months at most.
