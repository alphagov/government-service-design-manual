{:.intro}
The best way to help users is by making the simplest, clearest, transaction you can.
Sometimes though, you'll need to provide some extra help.

## How to write help text

Keep it short and concise and speak to the user in their language. 
Users are unlikely to read anything longer than 3 lines. 
Focus on user action.
Make it contextual - it should relate to the user's current situation.
Don’t give background information, eg ‘This used to be called X but in 2008 it was changed to Y’. 

Example:<br/>
Enter the years you’ve paid National Insurance.

[help text] These are the years you’ve worked and paid tax or the years when you’ve received benefits like Jobseeker’s Allowance. 

Instead of:<br/>
National Insurance contributions can consist of Class 1 payments for employed, Class 2 payments for self employed or voluntary Class 3 payments.There may be certain years when you’ve received benefits that cover some of your National Insurance contributions. If this is the case, you must also count those years. 

### Do explain:

* legal jargon
* unfamiliar concepts
* where to find obscure information
* what format the information should be given in
* what you do with personal information
* how they should make important decisions

### Don't explain:

The interface. If you have to do that you haven't made it simple enough.
If you find yourself writing things like 'Click on the green button at the bottom of the screen' you know the interface needs work.


## How to present help text

Here are three options. Try them in this order.


### 1. Inline help

Short, clear text positioned immediately above or below the part of the page it relates to. 
Use this for help that's relevant to the majority of users.


### 2. Expanding help text

A short link that expands into more detailed help when clicked on.

Used carefully this is a good way of keeping the interface free from clutter.

Only use this for help that's not relevant to most of your audience.
Remember - if most people need the text, don't hide it.

The link text tends to work better when it's targetted, rather than the generic 'Help' or 'Info'. For example:

* 'I can't find my National Insurance number'
* 'What's this?'


### 3. Detailed contextual help

Very occasionally you'll need to give users access to more detailed supporting content from within a transaction.

You'll need to decide how to display the content without people losing their place.
If you need to open a new browser window remember to tell people you're going to do this.
