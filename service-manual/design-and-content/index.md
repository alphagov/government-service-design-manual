People come to GOV.UK with specific needs. Anything that gets between our users and meeting those needs should be stripped away. The design of GOV.UK reflects this, existing primarily as a way of delivering the right content and services to our users. Find out here how we approach this challenge.

## GOV.UK design principles

Whether your designing content, interfaces or whole services for GOV.UK, you should start by reading our 10 design principles. They're easy to remember, and if you keep them in mind whilst you're working they'll guide you towards the kind of results we need for GOV.UK.

[Read the GOV.UK design principles](http://gov.uk/designprinciples)



## Content design

The [GOV.UK style guide](http://gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) tells you what writing conventions to adopt for GOV.UK. There's also more general advice on [how our users read](/service-manual/design-and-content/how-users-read.html) and how to [write for government services](/service-manual/design-and-content/writing-government-services.html) and [transactions](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/writing-for-transactions.html). We also have guidance on [data visualisation](/service-manual/design-and-content/data-visualisation.html).

[See all guides for content designers](/service-manual/content-designers)


## Interface design

First read about our approach to [accessibility](/service-manual/design-and-content/accessibility.html). Then, if you're working on the visual side of things there are guides on [typograpy](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/typography.html) and [colour palettes](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/colour-palettes.html).

If you're doing frontend coding you'll want to know about our [shared asset libraries](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/shared-asset-libraries.html) and [Sass repositories](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/sass-repositories.html). You'll also need to know which [browsers and devices](/service-manual/design-and-content/browsers-and-devices.html) to test with.

We also have guides on [forms](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/forms.html).
