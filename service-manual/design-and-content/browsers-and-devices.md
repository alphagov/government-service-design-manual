Services should be universally accessible, regardless of how the user is choosing to access them.

##Guidance

Due to the large range of browsers, devices and resolutions of access routes, it is to be expected that the user's experience of a service will vary as the technical capabilities on browsers and devices vary. You must verify that your service works across a representative range of these devices and browsers, and makes accommodations for creating good experiences in all of them.

##Verified browsers

These are the browsers we recommend testing on when developing your service.  This list strongly recommends testing on a range of browsers created within the last 3 years that cover the largest representation of the user base.

This list is based upon usage statistics for [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk).  It allows for a 95% coverage of all browsers used (the remaining browsers are individually insignificant).
Browsers not listed may still work well, and it should be noted that this is not a list that intends to suggest that these are the *only* browsers the service will work on - this is simply a benchmark for testing against to ensure that the service will likely work for as many users as possible alongside appropriate cost-effectiveness and development overhead.
Services should ensure there is a obvious way for users to report problems they may find, and additional testing and adjustments should be made upon receiving such a report.

*Note*: An exception is made for IE6, as this is still in large-scale use in government departments.

Two distinct levels of support are given and denoted next to each browser. Where 'latest version' is listed, it means the latest stable version plus one version back, as these browsers regularly self-update.

| Blackberry | 6+ | &nbsp; | Functional |

##Developing universally accessible services

Digital by default services must take into consideration the limitations of the browsers people use to access them. One important idea for achieving this is [progressive enhancement](/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement). This recognises that different bits of technology have different capabilities. Whilst everybody gets access to core functionality, those using more sophisticated technology get an enhanced experience.

Progressive enhancement is also important in delivering a consistent experience to people using mobile devices or those who may have limited bandwidth. Because mobile traffic now accounts for [13% of all internet use in the UK](http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_vs_desktop-GB-monthly-201211-201211-bar 'Mobile vs Desktop in United Kingdom on November 2012 Statcounter Global Stats') and around 20% of traffic to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk), this mode of access is not an optional extra to consider. Where we might previously have developed separate mobile and desktop versions of a service, or bought bespoke apps, design should now be done with one website in mind. This should be done using a [responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_design 'Responsive Web Design - Wikipedia') approach. This means websites adapt to suit the dimension of the screen being used to view it.

Donâ€™t try to build services for every possible combination of operating system and browser. Avoid the temptation of designing for the obvious without first researching your users.

###Audience
Every service has an audience and you should investigate yours to see whether it has particular characteristics that you need to be aware of. Do you have existing data for the browsers and devices that your audience has been using already? If so, analyse it to see if you can identify any patterns in usage, or any combinations of:

* operating system
* browser
* browser version
* screen size/resolution
* mobile device

This data may sometimes support the case for deprioritising certain development work: although most of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) is designed to work across all screen sizes, the [Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff) team chose not to tailor their tool to the smaller screen as it is largely used by office workers between 9 and 5. Equally, if your audience is likely to include those from within the public sector there may be higher use of older, more limited browsers.

Channel shift means you must also consider your potential future audience. It is anticipated that operating system, browser and device data from [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) will be published as part of the GDS [performance platform](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform.html) and this will provide a valuable insight into the audience for government services. Before launch we noted a marked difference between the existing non-government and government audiences so you should also investigate the data provided by [NetMarketShare](http://www.netmarketshare.com 'NetMarketShare') and [GlobalStats](http://gs.statcounter.com 'Statcounter GlobalStats') who can provide UK and global trends.


##Continuous compatibility
It is important to distinguish between those browsers and operating systems whose popularity is either increasing or holding steady and those for which the opposite is true. Although Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 have only been used by a minority (almost 5% of the total visits to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) since launch) this still accounts for a significant number of individuals who government services must take into account.

However, over time this will change. So it is important to set thresholds for abandoning support and for adopting new and emergent platforms. The iPad Mini, Kindle Fire, Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 highlight this dilemma - recently launched products might not appear in any data but it is likely that they will eventually enjoy widespread use.

Decisions about compatibility can not be something you specify at the start of the project and then forget about. Transformed digital services need to reflect and adapt to the broader internet context of their users on an ongoing basis.
