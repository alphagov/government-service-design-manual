The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom. No user should be excluded on the basis of disability. To do so would breach the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents). Your services must also comply with any other legal requirements, including providing services in accordance with your Welsh Langage Scheme, if you have one.

## Accessibility standard

As a starting point, your service should aim to meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) (WCAG) 2.0.

## Accessibility testing

Your service should be tested by disabled people, older people, and people who use assistive technologies. You should aim to do this at least twice as your service is developed.

## Accessibility statements and policies

We work hard to make our sites and services as accessible and usable as we can for everyone who needs to use them. The GOV.UK website does not include a separate accessibility statement, however, as we are not comfortable with a statement that draws a distinction between accessibility and any other aspect of best practice development. This [blogpost by GDS accessibility expert Léonie Watson](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/02/11/beyond-box-ticking/) explains in more detail why we took this decision.


## Assistive technologies

Your service should be usable by recent versions of [Jaws](http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp), [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/), [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/), [Window Eyes](http://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/) and [Supernova](http://www.yourdolphin.co.uk/productdetail.asp?id=5) screen readers, [ZoomText](http://www.aisquared.com/zoomtext/), [MAGic](http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/lv/magic-bl-product-page.asp) and basic operating system screen magnifiers, as well as speech recognition software including [Dragon Naturally Speaking](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm), and native operating system speech packages.


## Accessible formats

HTML is quicker, easier and more widely usable/accessible than PDF, but where no other option is possible the following [PDF guidance](/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/creating-accessible-PDFs.html) should be followed. There is more information on [choosing appropriate formats](/service-manual/design-and-content/choosing-appropriate-formats.html)


## Accessible content

Accessibility is more than checking the boxes of standards compliance. When writing content, consider what information would be useful to people with access needs.

For instance, in a ‘find my nearest’ service, consider user needs like: Is there disabled parking? How far is it from the entrance? What’s the terrain like? Uphill? Downhill? Will I have to cross any roads? etc.
