A service may fail to meet [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/index.html) at three points:

* during the service’s design after a review at GDS
* prior to going live
* when live, if it falls below the [performance targets](/service-manual/measurement) approved at launch

## Failure during service design

If a service isn’t being designed inline with the standard, or there is [no public written record of progress](/service-manual/communications/index.html), GDS will raise the issue with you and the [digital leader](/service-manual/the-team/digital-leader.html) and suggest action.

Progress towards meeting the standard will be assessed at every [spending control](/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html) point the service passes through. If the department can’t give sufficient evidence that the work completed so far is in line with the standard, further spending on the project won’t be approved. If the business case is rejected, GDS will explain what evidence the service team must give for funding to be released.

## Failure to pass a Digital by Default assessment

If a GDS assessment panel doesn’t pass a service, it won’t be awarded the standard and won’t appear on, or be linked to from, GOV.UK. The lead assessor will give feedback to you and the digital leader on what needs to be rectified. Depending on the stage of development, your team will be invited back to be re-assessed fully or against the failed criteria. If this needs only relatively minor changes, or a small amount of additional evidence, this can be done through correspondence.

If the service fails to pass an assessment twice, the Cabinet Office will write to the responsible minister explaining why the service has not yet been awarded the standard, and what remedial action is required.

## Ongoing performance

GDS will use assessments to review services that are failing to [maintain the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/maintaining-the-standard.html), and will call in service teams to explain drops in performance or satisfaction.
