The Government Digital Strategy explained that the scope of the service standard would not cover all of the 650-plus transactional services government provides to citizens and businesses. Government services cover a vast variety of activity, from the mainstream to the highly specialised. Applying the same standard to services dealing with a handful of transactions every year that was applied to those handling millions was unlikely to be helpful.

To establish whether your service needs to meet the service standard, answer the questions below.

Is your service:

- completely new or going through a redesign?
- processing (or likely to process) more than 100,000 transactions every year?
- the responsibility of a central government department, agency or non-departmental public body?
- being launched in April 2014 or after?

If you have answered yes to all of the questions above:

The service must meet the standard before it can go live on GOV.UK.

If you have answered no to one or more of these questions:

Your service does not have to meet the standard, although it will still be a useful guide to development. You should also try to answer the same questions that would apply to any service transformation ('Is the project cost-effective?', 'Should it be a priority for action now?' etc)
