While the information and guidance within the manual will be useful for teams in all services, [the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) itself will not apply to all government services. As described in the [Government Digital Strategy](/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research), only high-volume transactions being released after April 2014 will need to meet it.

## The criteria

To establish whether your service needs to meet the service standard, ask yourself if your service is:

* completely new and/or being redesigned?
* the responsibility of a central government department, agency or non-departmental public body?

If you have answered 'yes' to both of these then the service must meet the standard before it can go live.

If you have answered 'no' to any of these questions then your service does not have to meet the standard.


## Why the standard doesn't apply to everything
Government services cover a vast variety of activity, from the mainstream to the highly specialised. 

Applying the same standard to services dealing with a handful of transactions every year that was applied to those handling millions is unlikely to be helpful.
