## Scope of the standard

The Government Digital Strategy explained that the scope of the service standard would not cover all of the 650-plus transactional services government provides to citizens and businesses. Government services cover a vast variety of activity, from the mainstream to the highly specialised. Applying the same standard to services dealing with a handful of transactions every year that was applied to those handling millions was unlikely to be helpful. 

To establish whether your service needs to meet the service standard, answer the questions below. [Turn into a smart answer]

Is your service:
- completely new or going through a redesign?
- processing (or likely to process) more than 100,000 transactions every year?
- the responsibility of a central government department, agency or non-departmental public body?
- being launched in April 2014 or after?

If you have answered yes to all of the questions above, then it must meet the service standard before it can go live on GOV.UK. 

If you have answered no to one or more of these questions the standard should still be a useful guide to development. You should also answer the same questions that would apply to any service transformation, such as whether the project is cost-effective, and whether it should be priority for action now.
