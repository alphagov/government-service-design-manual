Assessments for services that have (or are likely to have) more than 100,000 transactions a year are completed by GDS. Planning ahead is very important as it can take up to 4 weeks to complete the assessment process.

## Arranging an assessment with GDS

You can start the assessment process by asking GDS Approvals (gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to arrange a Digital by Default Standard Service assessment. GDS will agree a date and time within 4 weeks and confirm the attendees from the service. The service team should give:

* a brief description of the service and its intended users
* the current development phase
* details of the service(s) the new one will replace or complement
* an up to date link to the most recent version of the service (a development environment link is fine)
* a high level technical architecture diagram
* details of any outstanding security or privacy accreditation

## Attending the assessment

You should give a brief overview of the service including a live demonstration. Video screens and cables will be provided. The assessment panel will ask you to answer questions to show how the service meets the standard. You will normally bring other team members along to represent different aspects of the service and help answer questions. Often they will be a technical architect, a designer, a user researcher or a delivery manager, but that’s up to you. The assessment can last up to 3 hours depending on the service’s complexity, and will assess against all 18 points in the standard.

## Outcomes from an assessment

You should expect to receive a result from an assessment within 3 working days. This will be an email to you and the responsible department’s digital leader. There are two possible outcomes from an assessment: pass and [not passed](/service-manual/digital-by-default/failure-to-meet-the-standard). You will have an opportunity to fact check the report before it is published on the [GDS Data Blog](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/all-service-assessments-and-self-certification/), usually within 5 working days.

When a service passes a beta assessment, you will be able to launch the service publicly with beta branding [on GOV.UK](/service-manual/domain-names/setting-up.html). When the service passes a live assessment, beta branding may be removed from the service. Any warnings on the GOV.UK start page will be removed.
