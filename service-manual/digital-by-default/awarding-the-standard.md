Meeting (and keeping) the standard isn't simply a 'one size fits all' exercise. All services within the [scope of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/scope-of-the-standard.html) will be assessed against the [criteria of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).

##How assessment works

A team's service manager will present [a public beta of the service](/service-manual/phases/beta.html) alongside [content from the service’s public blog](/service-manual/communications/index.html.html) to a [go live panel](/service-manual/digital-by-default/go-live-panel.html) including experts from within and outside government.

The service manager will have to demonstrate that the service and team have consistently met the criteria in the standard to the unanimous satisfaction of the panel. The panel will apply common sense and a degree of flexibility to their assessments, giving teams feedback and guidance about how to improve a service when it looks like they will not meet the standard.

The department or agency that owns the service is formally responsible for ensuring it achieves and maintains the standard, irrespective of whether it is designed, built and operated by in-house, external or mixed teams.

## Providing evidence

Having high quality, regularly updated and publicly available information about how services are being built is really important. It not only demonstrates commitment to meeting the standard, but also:

* contributes to a government-wide repository of best practise
* provides advice and guidance for other teams redesigning or building services
* is an easy way of sharing ideas within and across departments.

A [public blog](/service-manual/communications/index.html) is the best way of collecting and publishing this information. Publishing this information means that people from across (and outside of) government can follow the progress of a service, allowing teams to quickly get advice and test their assumptions with a wider community.

It also means that there is published audit trail of progress that can be used to support the decisions of the panel.

## Assessment throughout development

While there are no fixed deadlines for meeting the standard, we expect that redesign or transformation of a service should take 18-24 months. As a result, having feedback throughout the process is really important, reducing the risk of lengthy projects going off-track.

To enable this, and support an agile approach to design, progress against the standard will be monitored as part of existing [spending control processes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/spending-controls.html).

Departments currently need [Cabinet Office approval for digital spending](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1). To simplify this process, a dedicated account manager will work with each department in order to help prioritise their projects.

When a department makes a submission to their account manager for spending approval on services that fall within the [scope of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/scope-of-the-standard.html), GDS will assess whether the work completed so far is in line with it. 

If the service redesign or build process is at an early stage, GDS will make meeting the standard a condition of approval. 

If the service redesign or build process is at a more advanced stage, GDS will make recommendations for additional spending on the basis of the evidence available for a service being on track to meet the standard. This evidence will be taken from the team’s public blog. GDS will also explicitly state when the team should return for further approval.

A team will go through this process more than once to unlock spending approval for each phase of a service, supporting an iterative approach to service design. Rather than increasing the volume of paperwork the public blog will be used for evidence of progress, and will also help GDS to provide departments with targeted support and feedback on whether they are on track to meet the standard far in advance of a go live panel.
