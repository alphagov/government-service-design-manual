The process by which services achieve and keep the standard is intended to maximise knowledge sharing, ensure fair and consistent assessment, and avoid ‘one size fits all’ tickbox-style exercises.

In order to achieve the standard and have their service launched on GOV.UK, the responsible service manager will ultimately have to prove their service meets the [criteria of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) to the unanimous satisfaction of a Go Live panel including experts from within and outside government. 

The panel will apply common sense and a degree of flexibility to their assessments. However, all services within the [scope of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/scope-of-the-standard.html) will be assessed against the same set of criteria.

The Go Live panel will make their assessment on the basis of the [written evidence contained in the service’s public blog](/service-manual/digital-by-default/providing-evidence.html), which is a regularly updated record of how the service has been designed and built, and a live demonstration of the public beta service. 

The department or agency that owns the service is formally responsible for ensuring it achieves and maintains the standard, irrespective of whether it is designed, built and operated by in-house, external or mixed teams. 

## Assessment throughout development

For complex services, we expect the process will take around 18 months to two years, but there are no fixed deadlines for how long it should take a service to reach the standard. As a result, having feedback throughout the process is really important, reducing the risk of lengthy projects going off-track. 

To enable this, and support an agile approach to design, progress against the standard will be monitored as part of existing spending control processes. 

Departments currently need [Cabinet Office approval for digital spending](). To simplify this process, a dedicated account manager will work with each department in order to help prioritise their projects.

When a department makes a submission to their account manager for spending approval on services that fall within the [scope of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/scope-of-the-standard.html), GDS will assess whether the work completed so far is in line with it. If the service redesign or build process is at an early stage, GDS will make approval conditional on the proposed service being built to meet the standard. If the service redesign or build process is at a more advanced stage, GDS will make recommendations for additional spending on the basis of the evidence available for a service being on track to meet the standard. [This evidence will be taken from the team’s public blog](/service-manual/digital-by-default/providing-evidence.html). GDS will also explicitly state when the team should return for further approval.

The point of having multiple loops through this process is to effectively support an iterative approach to service design. Relying on the public blog for evidence of progress removes the need for additional paperwork. It will also provide departments with targeted support and feedback on whether they are on track to meet the standard far in advance of a Go Live panel, in order to take any corrective actions earlier. The number of loops a project will go through will vary, though GDS will seek to minimise wherever possible. GDS is currently working with HM Treasury and the Major Projects Authority to ensure current approval and assurance processes are better adapted for digital projects.

## Go Live panel

A Go Live panel will make the final decision on whether a service should be awarded the standard and be launched. The panel will convene within 2-3 weeks of a request being made by the responsible service manager. It will be chaired by GDS, and include a Digital Leader and a service manager (not from the presenting department) on the panel. It will also include other independent experts if suitable and available. Other Digital Leaders and service managers will be free to attend as observers.

The panel will ask questions about the service itself and the evidence set out in the team’s public record. At the conclusion of the meeting, the panel will:

- **Approve:** The service should be awarded the standard, and is ready to be launched on GOV.UK.
- **Resubmit:** The service is nearly ready, but there are some outstanding evidence gaps. The panel will agree a date to reconvene (ideally within 3 weeks) to consider new evidence or updates.
- **Reject:** The service is unable to demonstrate evidence for criteria seen as essential by the panel.
