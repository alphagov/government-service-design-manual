The 26 service standard points are grouped into the following themes, to help guide you through an assessment:

* User needs 
* The team 
* Security, privacy, tools and standards 
* Improving the service 
* Design 
* Assisted digital and channel shift 
* Analysis and benchmarking 
* Testing with the Minister 

For each point of the standard there is a list of common follow up and clarification questions which assessors often ask. There is also a list of suggested evidence a service manager can provide or discuss at the assessment, to show how the team has confidently met the standard point.

You can find the full list of prompts and evidence below:
