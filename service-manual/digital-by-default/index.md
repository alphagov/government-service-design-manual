## What is the Digital by Default Service Standard?
The [Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/) committed the government to ensuring all new or redesigned transactional services meet a Digital by Default Service Standard from April 2014.

Teams must demonstrate that they have met these before launch, and must be able to maintain this quality for the full life of the service.

To achieve the standard, the service team must demonstrate that they have:

1. understood users needs, conducting research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are and what that implies for digital and assisted digital service design
2. assembled a multidisciplinary team who can design, build and operate the service, led by a single, suitably skilled and empowered Service Manager
3. considered what user data and information the service will be providing or storing, and addressed the security level, legal responsibilities and risks associated with the service, consulting with experts where appropriate
4. considered the privacy risks to ensure that personal data collection requirements are appropriate
5. considered the tools and systems they will be using to build, host, operate and measure their service, and how to procure them
6. built a working prototype, using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual
7. established performance benchmarks, in consultation with GDS, using the four key indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual, against which the service will be measured
8. analysed the prototype service’s success, translating user feedback into features and tasks for the next phase of development
9. created a service that is simple and intuitive enough that users succeed first time, unaided
10. put appropriate assisted digital support in place, targeted towards those who genuinely need it
11. a plan (developed with GDS) for the phasing out of existing alternative channels where appropriate
12. integrated the service with any non-digital steps required for legal reasons
13. built a service with the same look, feel and tone as GOV.UK, using the service manual
14. the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis
15. made all new source code open and reuseable, and published it under appropriate licenses (or have provided a convincing explanation of why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code)
16. used open standards and common Government platforms (eg Identity Assurance) where available
17. an ongoing ability to test the end-to-end service as if it were in an environment identical to that of the live version, with dummy accounts and a representative sample of potential service users, on all common browsers and devices
18. instrumented analytics tools which collect performance data
19. built and resourced a service that can be improved on a very frequent basis, in response to user feedback or performance data for example
20. a plan in place for ongoing user testing, including the ability to support multivariate experiments
21. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high levels of user satisfaction across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the Performance Platform
22. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high completion rates across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the Performance Platform
23. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a low cost per transaction across the digital and assisted digital service that is reported on the Performance Platform
24. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a high digital take-up (and targeted assisted digital support at people who really need it) that is reported on the Performance Platform
25. a contingency ‘rollback’ plan in place should the service have to be taken temporarily offline
26. successfully tested the service from beginning to end with the Minister responsible for it
