## Introduction

The [Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/) committed the government to ensuring all new or redesigned transactional services meet a Digital by Default Service Standard from April 2014. 

Services must meet the standard before they are launched on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk). A draft version is set out below. It will be agreed and set in April 2013.

## The Digital by Default Service Standard

A team must demonstrate that they have done the following to achieve the standard:

1. conducted research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are, what the user needs are, and what that implies for their digital and assisted digital service design
2. put in place a multidisciplinary team, led by a single, suitably skilled and empowered Service Manager, to design, build, operate and run the service
3. considered the user data and information the service will be providing or storing, addressed the security level, legal responsibilities and risks associated with the service, consulting with experts where appropriate
4. considered the privacy risks to ensure that personal data collection requirements are appropriate 
5. considered the tools and systems they will be using to build, host, operate and measure their service, and how to procure them
6. built a working prototype, using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual
7. established performance benchmarks to define success in consultation with GDS, using the 4 key indicators (KPIs) defined in the manual against which the service will be measured
8. analysed the prototype service’s success and ensured that user feedback is translated into features for the next phase of development
9. created a service that is simple and intuitive enough that users succeed first time, unaided 
10. put appropriate assisted digital support in place, targeted towards those who genuinely need it
11. a plan in place (developed with GDS) for the phasing out of existing alternative channels where appropriate
12. considered the seamless integration of the service’s digital and any non-digital steps that are required for legal reasons
13. used the manual to develop the content and design to ensure the service has the same look, feel and tone as GOV.UK
14. got the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis
15. made all new source code open, reuseable and published under appropriate licenses (or else provide a convincing explanation of why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code)
16. used open standards and common Government platforms (e.g. Identity Assurance) where available
17. an ongoing ability to test the end-to-end service as if it were in an environment identical to that of the live version, with dummy accounts and a representative sample of potential service users, on all common browsers and devices
18. instrumented analytics tools and ensured that performance data can be collected
19. built and resourced a service that can be improved daily, ensuring that user feedback and performance data is translated into development
20. a plan in place for ongoing user testing, including the ability to support multivariate experiments
21. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high levels of user satisfaction across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the Performance Platform (PP)
22. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high transaction success rates across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the PP
23. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a low cost per transaction across the digital and assisted digital service that is reported on the PP
24. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a high digital take-up (and targeted assisted digital support at people who really need it) that is reported on the PP
25. a contingency ‘rollback’ plan in place should the service have to be taken temporarily offline
26. successfully tested the service from beginning to end with the responsible Minister

## How to meet the standard

This website, the [Government Service Design Manual](/service-manual/browse), contains all the information you need to start designing and building services that meet the standard.
