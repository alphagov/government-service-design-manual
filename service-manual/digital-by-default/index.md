<div class="intro">

  <p>The <a href="http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/">Government Digital Strategy</a> committed the government to ensuring all new or redesigned transactional services meet a Digital by Default Service Standard from April 2014.</p>

  <p>To do this, teams must demonstrate that they have met the following criteria before launch, and must be able to maintain this quality for the full life of the service.</p>
