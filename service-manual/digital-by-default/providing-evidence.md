## Providing evidence

Having high quality, regularly updated and publicly available evidence to demonstrate how services have met the standard is really important. It provides the whole of government with a repository of information to use in other similar service transformations, and an easy way of sharing ideas within and across departments. It means that GDS can provide early advice if services begin to move off-track. It means there is published audit trail of progress that can be used to support the decisions of the Go Live panel. And it means the whole process is transparent and open to people ultimately using the service.

### How to get a blog

GDS is setting up a GOV.UK blogging platform to help services provide evidence in this way. It will be ready from the beginning of May. More details about how to set up a blog here will be available soon. 

If your department or team already has a blog, there’s no need to start an additional one. [Let us know where it is](mailto:dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk), and GDS will make sure it is linked to from the GOV.UK platform -- so there is one place that hosts all the service team blogs in government. 

### How to blog

The manual has plenty of useful resources explaining how to write effectively for an online audience. The guides on [how government should write](/service-manual/design-and-content/writing-government-services.html) and [how users read](/service-manual/design-and-content/how-users-read.html) are a good place to start. To get sense of the style and tone, look at the [GDS](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) or [Ministry of Justice](http://blogs.justice.gov.uk/digital/) blogs.

How to write a blog - guidance from comms. [Link to guidance, to insert]

Almost every blog post is likely to be one of two types; weeknotes or spotlights. 

A weeknote is a short weekly update that covers what the team has done this week, what it plans to do next week, and any blockers or worries for the team. It will usually be written at the end of each sprint. Here are some examples of weeknotes. 

A spotlight is a more detailed post that looks at how the team has addressed specific issues or problems. Teams may want to write a spotlight post to cover how they’ve met a specific part of the standard. They’re particularly helpful for explaining approaches that might help others. This post on content design for the GOV.UK beta site is a typical example of a spotlight-style post. 

### Writing for the right audience

Service team blogs will be read by lots of different people. This is something that their authors must bear in mind. 

First, they will be read by the service’s users, the public. Amongst other things, that means resisting the use of acronyms and jargon as much as possible. Following this rule will also help senior internal stakeholders to use the blog for a quick overview of the team’s progress. 

They will also be read by the [Go Live panel](/service-manual/digital-by-default/awarding-the-standard.html#go-live-panel) to help determine whether a service is ready to be launched. Clarity on what has been done and why, and pointing to evidence for taking decisions on service design will be what they look for in their assessments. Woolly words and unsubstantiated assertions will not help. 

Other teams in government will read the blogs to find out how people going through similar challenges overcame them. Blog posts should therefore be written with some consideration of any broader application an approach, tool or technique may have. That applies as much to things that didn’t work as things that did. 

### Tagging posts

One of the big advantages of blogs is the ability to ‘tag’ posts. Tags make it easy to search and filter posts, so the blog as a whole is a more useful source of information for those looking for guidance on a specific topic or service. 

Teams should tag their posts with:

- the name of their service (eg ERTP)
- the number and short form of the [service standard criteria](/service-manual/digital-by-default) the post refers to (eg 2 - multidisciplinary team, 18 - instrumented analytics)

Posts can be tagged with multiple service standard criteria if appropriate. 

### Editorial and comments

More information on editorial guidance and commenting will be available once the GOV.UK blogging platform goes live.
