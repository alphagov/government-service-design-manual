Having high quality, regularly updated and publicly available evidence to demonstrate how services have met the standard is really important. It provides the whole of government with a repository of information to use in other similar service transformations, and an easy way of sharing ideas within and across departments.

We expect most teams to generate this information in the form of a public blog, published through the GOV.UK blogging platform.

Publishing this information on a public blog means that people from across (and outside of) government can follow the progress of a service, allowing teams to quickly get advice and test their assumptions with a wider community.

It also means that there is published audit trail of progress that can be used to support the decisions of the Go Live panel.

## How to get a blog

GDS is setting up a GOV.UK blogging platform to help services provide evidence in this way. It will be ready from the beginning of May. More details about how to set up a blog will be available soon.

If your department or team already has a blog, there’s no need to start an additional one. [Let us know where it is](mailto:dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk), and GDS will make sure it is linked to from the GOV.UK platform -- so there is one place that hosts all the service team blogs in government.

## How to write a blog post

The manual has plenty of useful resources explaining how to write effectively for an online audience. The guides on [how government should write](/service-manual/design-and-content/writing-government-services.html) and [how users read](/service-manual/design-and-content/how-users-read.html) are a good place to start. To get sense of the style and tone, look at the [GDS](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) or [Ministry of Justice](http://blogs.justice.gov.uk/digital/) blogs.

### Writing for the right audience

Service team blogs will be read by lots of different people.

First, they will be read by the service’s users, the public. Amongst other things, that means resisting the use of acronyms and jargon as much as possible. Following this rule will also help senior internal stakeholders to use the blog for a quick overview of the team’s progress.

They will also be read by the [Go Live panel](/service-manual/digital-by-default/awarding-the-standard.html#go-live-panel) to help determine whether a service is ready to be launched. Clarity on what has been done and why, and pointing to evidence for taking decisions on service design will be what they look for in their assessments. Woolly words and unsubstantiated assertions will not help.

Other teams in government will read the blogs to find out how people going through similar challenges overcame them. Blog posts should therefore be written with some consideration of any broader application an approach, tool or technique may have. That applies as much to things that didn’t work as things that did.
