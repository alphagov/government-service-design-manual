Assessments for services that have (or are likely to have) fewer than 100,000 transactions a year are completed by an assessor within the service’s responsible department. The department will be responsible for the assessment of a service and the process to arrange this will vary by department. The digital leader will then certify the service conforms to the Digital by Default service standard.

## Arranging an assessment with your digital leader

You should contact your digital leader who will assign a lead assessor trained by GDS. You must give a brief overview of the service including a live demonstration. The lead assessor will expect you to answer questions to show how the service meets the standard. You will normally bring other team members along to represent different aspects of the service and help answer questions. Often they will be a technical architect, a designer, a user researcher or a delivery manager, but that’s up to you.

## Outcomes from an assessment

The responsible digital leader will consider the recommendations from the lead assessor to certify the service with GDS. The assessment will be filed with GDS and a report will be created. You will have the chance to fact check the report before it is published on the [GDS Data Blog](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/all-service-assessments-and-self-certification/), usually within 5 working days.

A certified service may launch publicly with beta branding [on GOV.UK](/service-manual/domain-names/setting-up.html) after the beta assessment. When the service passes a live assessment, beta branding may be removed from the service. Any warnings on the GOV.UK start page will be removed.
