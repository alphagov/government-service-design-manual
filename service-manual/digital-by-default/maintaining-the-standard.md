The launch of a service on GOV.UK is only the beginning. Once it has been published, users are the arbiters of its quality. Having designed the service to be iteratively developed using performance data and user insight, service teams will have all the tools and techniques they need to continuously improve what they offer. Performance against the four key indicators will be tracked and publicly displayed.

To keep the standard, the service team **must** demonstrate that:

- they [continuously update and improve the service](/service-manual/agile/continuous-delivery.html) on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand
- they contribute to best practice developed across government, and share knowledge through the service manual
- high levels of [user satisfaction](/service-manual/measurement/user-satisfaction.html) are consistently maintained in the digital and assisted digital service
- high levels of [transaction completion](/service-manual/measurement/completion-rate.html) are consistently maintained in the digital and assisted digital service
- [cost per transaction](/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction.html) is decreasing in line with plans submitted ahead of the service’s launch
- [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html) is increasing in line with plans submitted ahead of the service’s launch and assisted digital support is targeted at the people who really need it
- all new source code is open, reuseable and published under appropriate licenses (or else there is a convincing explanation of why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code)
