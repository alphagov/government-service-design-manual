The [Performance Platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance) is for service
managers that need to be able to make data-driven decisions based on both
digital and non‑digital sources.

It’s a toolkit that allows you to supply service data in return for alerts, visualisations and structured data, which can then be used to:

* improve services
* meet [the service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default)
* gain insight by comparing data across multiple services and sources

##What the platform will offer

The Performance Platform will provide:

* visualisations
* alerts
* dashboards
* feeds

This will help with making timely and transparent decisions about your service and the content that government offers.

The platform will combine different sources of information:

* service desks
* infrastructure
* analytics
* surveys
* finance data

Combining these sources will produce information that encourages a greater understanding of the data, rather than simply communicating facts. It will:

* make it possible for government to make decisions based on data
* do the hard work to make data collection, retrieval, and presentation simple for users
* be open to any government service supplying their data and customising their outputs
* be open to the public
* be independent of proprietary monitoring software, eg Google Analytics
* automate routine analysis and visualisation, and use insights to provoke further detailed analysis

##Put data in

You will be able to supply your service performance data via standard
[Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](http://techterms.com/definition/api).
These APIs will be defined, documented and supported by the Performance
Platform team. Your service will be responsible for collecting and supplying
data to the API.

Your service can also send additional data. For instance, there might be data that’s important but there isn’t yet an existing module to make use of it. Your service will be able to start sending it to the platform straight away, so that when an appropriate module is available, the historical data is already there.

##Get useful insights out

Designed by the Performance Platform team, the platform will be made up of a
series of modules that you can choose from. The team will work closely with
you and your service in this process.

When a new module is added, it will be offered to all services on the platform. Each service will have the ability to decide whether or not to use it.

There will be default modules that are:

* relevant to all services
* relevant to similar groups of services (eg applying for something, requesting information, booking an appointment)
* [Key Performance Indicators](/service-manual/measurement/)

You’ll also have the ability to develop your own custom modules for your service.
