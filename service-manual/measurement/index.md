It's essential that we measure how services are performing to encure that services continue to meet user needs in a cost-effective and efficient way.

The metrics a service monitors are a way of starting a conversation around the strengths and weaknesses of a service, helping teams to investigate ways of making the service better over time.

## What will you measure

The [digital by default service standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) sets four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of your service: 

* [cost per transaction](/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction.html)
* [user satisfaction](/service-manual/measurement/user-satisfaction.html)
* [completion rate](/service-manual/measurement/completion-rate.html)
* [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html)

These aren't the only things a service will measure. Each team will want to identify unique indicators to help judge the effectiveness of a service, and you can read [guidance on establishing these bespoke KPIs](/service-manual/measurement/other-kpis.html)too.

## What happens to the data

Once live, service performance will be monitored and displayed on the [performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance). This data will be presented in uniquely configurable modules, and is visible to the public.

You will then want to use the data to [investigate how well a service is performing, and as a prompt for further investigation and testing](/service-manual/measurement/using-data.html).
