Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure of how well digital by default service is working. You will monitor this on a monthly basis to track that it is on course with the desired performance levels.

## What you'll be measuring

Digital take up is the amount of people completing your transaction online, including [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital/index.html) users.

A digital transaction is one where the main interaction between the user and the service has been through a digital user interface. Still classify transactions as digital, even if only a part of a transaction is completed online.

## How to measure digital take-up

1.    Take the number of completed digital transactions in a calendar month.
2.    Divide it by the total number of transactions in the same month, expressed as a percentage.

The total number of transactions will be made up of all non-digital transactions, including call centre transactions and paper-based transactions. Record and collect this data to make sure your digital take-up figure is accurate.

## The level of digital take-up to aim for

The publication '[Digital Landscape research](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/)' found that 82% of adults in the UK are online, so it's sensible to aim for something in that region. However, about [a third](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#fig-2) of those online have never accessed government information or services online, so this will involve a significant channel shift for most services.

## Services for users who are more or less than 82% online

Who is online, and how often, varies by: 

* age
* gender
* socio-economic status

Use the 'Digital landscape research' as a guide. It has a [useful breakdown](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#who-is-online-and-who-is-offline) of who is onlie and offline.

## Achieving your digital take-up targets

Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure. Look to achieve the target level within 5 years of launch

##How to increase digital take-up

Read guidance on [increasing digital take-up](/service-manual/communications/increasing-digital-takeup.html).

## What about assisted digital?

Some users will never use the digital service, but will still have to have access to the same level of service as those using your digital service. Departments will need to determine the appropriate mix of channels to support assisted digital users. Read [guidance on assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) for more information.
