Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure of how well digital by default service is working. You'll monitor this on a monthly basis to track that it's on course with the desired performance levels.

## What you'll be measuring

Digital take-up is the proportion of transactions completed online.

A digital transaction is one where the main interaction between the user and the service has been through a digital user interface. Classify transactions as digital only if a significant part of a transaction is completed online.

## Assisted digital support

Assisted digital support is provided for people who are not able to use digital services without help. Services should be designed so that the need for assisted digital support is minimal. Assisted digital transactions should be counted separately from digital transactions and should not count towards a service's digital take-up. 

Read our [guidance on assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) for more information.

## How to measure digital take-up

1.    Take the number of completed digital transactions in a calendar month.
2.    Divide it by the total number of transactions in the same month, expressed as a percentage.

The total number of transactions will be made up of all non-digital transactions, including call centre transactions and paper-based transactions. Record and collect this data to make sure your digital take-up figure is accurate.

## The level of digital take-up to aim for

The [Digital Landscape Research](/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) found that 82% of adults in the UK are online, so it's sensible to aim for something in that region. However, about a third of those online have never accessed government information or services online, so this will involve a significant channel shift for most services.

## Services for users who are more or less than 82% online

Who's online, and how often, varies by: 

* age
* gender
* socio-economic status

Use the [Digital Landscape Research](/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) as a guide. It has a useful breakdown of who's online and offline.

## Achieving your digital take-up targets

Digital take-up is a long-term strategic measure. Look to achieve the target level within 5 years of launch.
