Cost per transaction is an important measure of a service’s efficiency. As services become more efficient, the cost per transaction will fall.

## What you will be measuring

Cost per transaction is a measure of the total cost to the government of providing each completed transaction.

You will also want to measure the difference in the cost of the transaction through each available channel. Understanding these costs will help you to accurately forecast savings and build a strong business case for making services digital by default.

## How to measure cost per transaction

The *average* cost per transaction is calculated as the total cost of providing the service divided by the total number of completed transactions.

The total cost includes all fixed and variable costs of the transaction through a given channel, including overheads. It does not include start up costs.

Where resources (eg call centres) are shared with other services, costs should be apportioned. For example, if half of all calls received relate to a specific service, then 50% of the call centre costs should be apportioned to that service.

### Cost per digital transaction

The cost per *digital* transaction is the total cost of providing the digital service divided by the total number of transactions completed digitally, including [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) transactions.

Where processes and costs are common to more than one channel (eg processing wet signatures for passports, or printing driving licences), they should be apportioned. For example, if half of all transactions are completed digitally, then 50% of the common costs should be apportioned to the digital channel.

## What costs should be included

The full cost of the transaction should include:

* accommodation, including capital charges for freehold properties
* fixtures and fittings
* maintenance
* utilities
* office equipment, including IT systems
* postage, printing, telecommunications
* total employment costs of those providing the service, including training
* overheads, eg (shares of) payroll, audit, top management costs, legal services, etc
* raw materials and stocks
* research and development
* depreciation of start up and one-off capital items
* taxes: VAT, council tax, stamp duty, etc
* capital charges (if they were not met separately when the service was established)
* notional or actual insurance premiums
* fees to sub-contractors
* distribution costs, including transport
* advertising
* bad debts
* provisions

The following should be excluded:

* enforcement costs
* replacement costs of items notionally insured
* start up costs (those which can be capitalised in the accounts)

## How to calculate your cost per transaction target

Having agreed a goal for your digital take-up, the following formula will provide a starting point for discussions with GDS on your overall cost per transaction.

* goal for cost per transaction (Target)
* current overall cost per transaction (A)
* current digital cost per transaction (B)
* current digital take-up (X)
* digital take-up goal (Y)

> Target=A+(((B-A)/(1-X))*(Y-X))

For example, if the current average cost per transaction is £2 and digital cost per transaction is 50p, and if current digital take-up is 40% and the target is 80%, the target for average cost per transaction would be £1.

GDS can calculate this for you based on current figures.

## How frequently should I measure cost per transaction?

Cost per transaction is measured on a quarterly basis. It should cover the last twelve months to eliminate seasonal fluctuations.

Cost per transaction should be measured for the existing service - if there is one - to create a baseline against which future cost per transaction can be compared. When the digital service is exposed to real users (whether in alpha or beta) it should be included in the reported cost per transaction.
