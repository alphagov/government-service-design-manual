##Core KPIs

The Government digital strategy specifies four core KPIs that all departments must monitor in order to meet the digital by default standard and go live on GOV.UK.

These guides explain how each KPI should be measured and reported:

* [cost per transaction](/service-manual/measurement/cost-per-transaction.html)
* [user satisfaction](/service-manual/measurement/user-satisfaction.html)
* [completion rate](/service-manual/measurement/completion-rate.html)
* [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html)

These core KPIs provide a consistent set of cross-government metrics for digital service delivery.

##Other KPIs

In addition to the four core KPIs it is recommended that you consider other useful KPIs specific to your service that will help you measure and improve its performance.

This guide was developed by GDS to help you move from identifying and measuring KPIs, through to presenting and acting on the data.

The guide follows a seven stage iterative process:

##Understand user / stakeholder needs

Different sets of users within each department will typically have their own requirements for each service.

A Service Manager will need to see a range of metrics that help them make decisions about the service on a daily basis.

Technical requirements might include improving response time or server resilience; financial requirements could include reducing costs or increasing revenue. There may be a customer service requirement to improve customer satisfaction, or wider strategic aims to reduce fraud and error.

These needs will typically be reflected in the organisation’s business objectives or in the business case for transforming a service.

You will need to identify the various users within your organisation, and prioritise their requirements.

###Checklist
1. Have you identified who your users / stakeholders are?
2. Have you articulated your users / stakeholders needs?
3. Have you prioritised services?

##Decide what to measure
Develop simple, actionable and collectable metrics based on your understanding of user / stakeholder needs. Identify where that information will come from and how frequently it will be needed. Think especially about the functions your service is relying on and try to identify some KPIs to ensure you are constantly monitoring and improving these functions.

###KPI examples:

* Number of downloads
* Drop off rate
* Payment success

It's good practice to record every event generated by the system even if it’s not currently of interest. Measure everything (where it is cost-effective and practical to do so). This maximises the flexibility to come back later and revise the chosen metrics and tailor data visualisations to different audiences.

###Checklist
1. Are your metrics simple, actionable and collectable?
2. Have you mapped your metrics to the relevant audience?
3. Have you identified where your metrics will be sourced from?
4. Do you know how frequently performance information is required by your users?

###Example

An approach that worked well for us on GOV.UK was to run a brainstorming session to generate a long list of metrics which we then narrowed down by asking senior managers, if you had to choose one KPI, what would it be?

##Install and configure measurement platforms

Install and configure measurement platforms that meet your needs, for example digital analytics, customer feedback, web operations. You should use platforms that enable the data to be piped automatically into other systems. Using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) will stop you having to input data manually and allows for aggregation across multiple platforms.

###Checklist

1. Have you installed and configured digital/web analytics?
2. Have you configured your web analytics software with the appropriate [conversion funnels?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_funnel)
3. Do you have the capability to run user satisfaction surveys?
4. Do you have the capability to do [A/B testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_testing) and [multivariate testing?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_testing)
5. Do you have software installed for monitoring service uptime and performance?
6. Can you generate custom performance data based on system-generated events?

Ensure you own the data and have access to the raw data as well as reports. Make sure data is not disposed of after a short period of time.

##Establish a baseline

Establish a 'baseline' based on current performance trends by channel, against which changes to the service will be judged. This will help you pinpoint the effectiveness of your initiatives, and identify what worked.

###Checklist
1. Have you measured your current performance?
2. Have you compared your performance with similar types of service (e.g. by transaction category)?
3. Do you know who your users are in terms of age, disability, socio-economic group and internet usage?

It is good practice to look at performance trends over time, rather than take a snapshot at a particular point in time. Peaks and dips in performance are then measured relative to this base (or trend) line which helps to identify the effect of communications or design initiatives. It also reveals seasonal variations in performance.

##Aggregate data

Collect and aggregate performance information from multiple sources and across multiple channels. Make sure you understand what this will mean in terms of system requirements.

###Checklist

1. Have you collected data on costs, usage and performance?
2. Have you collected performance data from digital and non-digital channels?
3. Do you know how many people use the service, by channel?
4. Have you aggregated performance data to enable it to be easily combined?

Combining data often reveals useful insights, for example into service efficiency (eg cost per transaction and total cost to serve) or proportional usage by channel (eg percentage digital uptake vs post, phone etc).

##Analyse and visualise data

Communicate performance information to your users through the appropriate dashboards, reports and alerts. Highlight specific segments that you know users are interested in, and make sure that your visualisations are simple, actionable and contain minimal amounts of [chart junk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk).

###Checklist

1. Have you done any segmentation (i.e. analysed performance data by segment)?
2. Have you designed the appropriate dashboards, reports and alerts?
3. Are your data visualisations visible to their intended audience?
4. Have you followed best practice design principles for data visualisation?

###Typical segments include:

- **Channel used to access service:** through which channel(s) did the user find out about and attempt to use the service?
- **New vs. repeat visitors:** are first time users behaving differently to those who have used the service before?
- **Geographical region:** how popular is the digital service by region and how does that compare with online penetration in general?
- **Product type:** does the user experience vary depending on the type of product or service?
- **Value:** is performance dependent on the monetary value of the product or service being sought?
- **Dashboards:** are objective-focused and will help inform decisions, often with the help of real-time data.
- **Reports:** provide regular, scheduled snapshots of data and tend to require extra - context and time to digest.
- **Alerts:** are used to inform the users about a change or an event, often using attention-grabbing delivery mechanisms.

By making your visualisations clearly visible you maximise the likelihood that the information will be acted upon - and services thereby improved.

Best practices include:

- **keeping charts plain:** don’t use shading, 3D or other distracting effects
- **removing clutter:** don’t use trend lines, grid lines, unnecessary labelling
- **not using pie charts:** they require more space and are harder to read than bar charts
- **using text where a chart adds nothing.**

###Example

**Developer dashboards**

On GOV.UK dashboards keep our developers and editors up to date with the latest status reports and highlight any critical problems. They are displayed on large screens close to developers’ desks so that they can be easily monitored. This means that bugs can be spotted quickly and fixed.
Read this [blog article](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/08/radiating-information/) to find out how these dashboards were developed.

##Monitor, iterate, and improve

Test a range of performance improvement initiatives and monitor to see which work well. These can be piloted on a subset of your users to minimise risk. Implement the best performing solutions widely and then repeat this process relentlessly: what you measure will change over the course of a product or project's lifetime.

###Checklist

1. Are you monitoring and acting upon user feedback?
2. Have you done any  [A/B testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_testing) or [multivariate testing?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_testing)
3. Have you taken an iterative approach to developing your service?

Any service that meets user needs will include an element of user feedback. This should be monitored and acted upon so as to continually improve the service for users.
A range of options are available for improving the overall performance of a service. The following examples are based on the [4 Ps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix) of marketing:

**Price:** can the price be changed, for example to attract people to the digital channel?

**Product:** can the user experience be improved (eg from user feedback, user testing, A/B testing, multivariate testing)?

**Placement:** can the digital service URL be placed on printed materials and voice recordings?

**Promotion:** can greater use of email and social media be used to promote repeated use of the digital service?
Taking an iterative approach to service development increases the pace of improvement and minimises the risk of failure. Don’t wait until the end to do this, it should happen continuously throughout the process.

###Example

**A/B testing**

![Image showing different coloured buttons used on GOV.UK](/service-manual/assets/images/kpis/ab-testing.png)

On GOV.UK we're using A/B testing to see how colour changes can affect user behaviour. This is an example of how we are designing services based on user data.
