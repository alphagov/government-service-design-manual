## Cloud first

Government currently has a [Cloud First](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-adopts-cloud-first-policy-for-public-sector-it)
policy for public sector IT. This policy specifically states that:

>  public sector organisations should consider and fully evaluate potential
cloud solutions first -- before they consider any other option

It is worth noting as well that:

> This approach is mandated to central government and strongly recommended
to the wider public sector. Departments will remain free to choose an
alternative to the cloud if they can demonstrate that it offers better
value for money.

## Cloud security principles

With the move to using third party hosted and managed services comes a series
of new security challenges. With that in mind [CESG](https://www.cesg.gov.uk/),
the national technical authority, have produced a set of guidance.

The [introduction ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-security-guidance-introduction/cloud-security-guidance-introduction)
covers how the guidance was developed and how it can be used to
build trust in cloud based systems and suppliers.

This guidance begins with outlining [14 principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-service-security-principles/cloud-service-security-principles)
through which we can analyse the security of a cloud based system.

1. Data in transit protection
2. Asset protection and resilience
3. Separation between consumers
4. Governance
5. Operational security
6. Personnel security
7. Secure development
8. Supply chain security
9. Secure consumer management
10. Identity and authentication
11. External interface protection
12. Secure service administration
13. Audit information provision to consumers
14. Secure use of the service by the consumer

## Implementing the cloud security principles

The guidance also includes an [implementation guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles)
which contains for each of the above principles

* A description of the principle -- what it is and why it is important
* A number of implementation objectives -- how the principle should be satisfied
* A number of approaches that can be taken to meet the implementation objectives, attracting different residual risks

Rather than replicate the good work of existing standards bodies this guidance
references existing work wherever possible. In particular extensive reference
is made to:

* [ISO/IEC 27001 -- information security management](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm)
* [Cloud Security Alliance -- cloud controls matrix](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/ccm/)

## Not all principles are relevant to all services

The guidance also includes recommendations for integrating this with
existing [risk management processes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-security-guidance-risk-management/cloud-security-guidance-risk-management).
In particular this recommends asking

> Which security principles are relevant?

The 14 principles should not be viewed as a checklist to be used in all cases.
