This document outlines the typical scope of infrastructure and web operations
(sometimes erroneously referred to as hosting) work on a large service
redesign project.

The sample list of user stories provided is not intended to be a complete list of
all areas of interest nor are you likely to need to do all of this for every service.
The idea is for this list to be a good starting place from where to you can write
additional stories, delete ones you do not require and split stories into smaller
ones. Importantly you also need to provide your own acceptance criteria
specific to the needs of your service.

Remember these stories are [a placeholder for a conversation](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories#promise-of-a-conversation).
For some contexts, that conversation will be 'this does not apply to my
service' -- that is fine. But there will almost certainly be other stories not
listed here which do apply.

## The problem

An issue we have observed on a number of projects is a lack of understanding
early on in a project about the work required to run a large online
service. Often this is placed under  _hosting_ and is investigated too late
in the process.

## Intended audience

The hosting of a complex and sensitive software application requires a team
of people with specialist skills to design, setup and operate. Because this
work is generally not user facing and can be highly technical it is sometimes
easy to leave until later -- with potentially dire consequences for launching
safely and on time.

### Service managers
Does your team have people who deeply understand this topic? If you are not an
expert then it is important to involve people permanently in the team
who are. They can explain the technical trade offs and decisions which may
affect your service.

### Delivery managers
As well as understanding the potentially large scope of work, many of the areas
discussed here have lead times associated with third parties. The earlier
stories related to these topics are brought into project backlogs the sooner
estimates can be made and deadlines understood.

## Stories
The following stories are intended to provide a starting point for any project,
rather than be a complete set. Individual projects would be expected to take
and modify stories as needed and importantly to apply their own acceptance
criteria specific to their requirements.

The majority of these stories are from the point of view of developers, web
operations engineers and the responsible service manager. Although not ideal,
for this particular technical topic this works reasonably well. Feel free
to change the focus when using them in your backlog.
