Now you’ve created a [helpdesk](/service-manual/operations/helpdesk.html), it’s time to figure out how to make the best use of user feedback so you can improve your service and your user experience.

## Arrange enquiry data into subgroups

Your ability to act quickly and constructively on user feedback depends on how well you can arrange enquiries for analysis.

How you choose to put enquiries into relevant subgroups will depend on:

* how complex your enquiries are
* the sophistication of the systems you use to handle them 

These factors will decide if the process of arranging enquiries will be carried out manually (staff create the metadata for the enquiries they handle) or be automated (the software you use for handling enquiries will add most of the metadata automatically).

At the very least, arrange enquiries by:

* channel (phone, email, chat, social media, surface mail, etc) 
* the target group that can act on the feedback

## Potential subgroup categories

In addition to the very basic channel and target arrangements mentioned above, the following categories may be suitable.

### Enquiry type

Is the enquiry a: 

* question
* problem
* complaint
* Freedom of Information (FOI) request
* non-actionable rant

### Requester details

Given user privacy concerns, spend time thinking about how you’ll collect data on your users. At the very least, gather minimal information on who is requesting assistance.

### Reply type
Is a reply necessary/expected or not?

### Enquiry status
Is an enquiry open, pending some other action, solved, etc

### Enquiry category or categories
Some internal sectional or functional categories along which you’ll want to be able to stratify--think of separate URLs or sections on a large website as a concrete example.

### Service category or categories

Capture information on the different aspects of the handling processes. You’ll want to have information on:

* support level
* priority
* internal resolving group
* resolving agent(s)
* day/date/time received
* day/date/time resolved

### Root cause category or categories
The ultimate reason for contacting helpdesk, eg:

* page failing to load
* database down
* forgotten password
* user error
* software bug

As with most of these, tailor these categories based on the specifics of your product and support model.

## Send data to appropriate groups
Now that you’ve gathered your data, you need to decide how to share it. Sharing data is easier if all the data can be handled and used directly within your organisation. However, it’s likely that different teams will act on different types of problems, and some may be outside of your department.

If possible through your system, use automation for sharing data.

## Treating enquiries as defects

Treating each enquiry from a user as being due to a defect in the service itself is a very ambitious improvement model. Here enquiries are either seen as a fault in your support model for your service, or in the communications processes you use to handle enquiries. 

While this can exaggerate the reason for some kinds of contact (is a user’s email of thanks and appreciation genuinely a defect?) it’s an excellent way to direct critical thinking on how you provide service.


## Improvement projects
Once the enquiry-level improvement data has been sent to the right group, begin doing analysis for improving processes. Join your enquiry level data with cost data to help prioritise which areas to target first. But you can also simply use the number (or percentage) of affected users as a tool for prioritising.

In any case, make sure you have access to staff with experience in process analysis and improvement, ideally with relevant contact centre or technology experience. Directly involving the individuals who handle enquiries and those who built the service into improvement projects will produce better and faster results.
