History is littered with countless Government projects which collapsed under load or which worked slowly enough to frustrate users. As a Government service it is important that your systems and applications are performant and can deal with expected (and unexpected) levels of traffic. 

This means doing some capacity planning work up front but it also means doing specific load and performance testing. 

## Capacity planning

Capacity planning is the process of determining what amount of infrastructure and software is required to run a live system.

Importantly you should also look at how this changes over time. Will traffic or database load increase every month as the site grows, or are some days or months (self assessment deadline or bank holidays) particularly spikey. 

The output should help with both estimating ongoing costs as well as setting up realistic load and performance tests.

## Test things yourself, as well as with vendors

There are several companies that offer products and services around load testing. In many cases working with these can be useful, especially for final testing or testing of mature components. 

However it's important to also have some capability within your development team to do more ad-hoc load and performance testing. This is important to allow for a [rapid iterative development style](/service-manual/agile), otherwise scalability or performance issues may be introduced but caught late, when they are much harder to fix.

## Types of testing

Although related, and tested in similar ways, load testing and performance testing are done for different reasons. It's worth understanding the subtle difference and making sure you consider both when testing and analysing results.

### Load testing

We test sites and applications under realistic load to ensure that, when launched, they work for the people using them. This should involve testing in load in excess of expected traffic in order to simulate certain types of [Denial of Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) (DoS) attack, including a [Distributed Denial of Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack) (DDoS) attack.

### Performance testing

Even if a site or application is able to scale out successfully it doesn't mean it is fast. Site performance is a factor of many things, from the software running the site to the networks, proxies and caches involved in serving traffic over the internet. 

Fast sites are generally much more effective to the extent that Google now includes performance in its algorithms for determining which sites to feature in search results.
