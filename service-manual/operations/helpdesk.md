You need to form a helpdesk as part of providing a high quality service. A helpdesk is a dedicated group of specialists -- or current staff dedicating some of their time -- that:

* handle user requests for information
* help direct users to the information they want

Your planning will benefit from the use of traditional contact centre management and planning skill sets.
If you don’t have access to staff with these skills, you may have to work closely with other groups who do in a consultancy capacity. This may include the team at GDS, or
[outside specialists](/service-manual/the-team/working-with-specialists.html).

## Volume forecast: how many and what type of enquiry

You need to have an idea of the volume and type of enquiries you’ll receive. In many cases, you can use historical data for similar services as a baseline.
Also take into account the contact methods you intend to support, such as:

* email
* phone
* online chat
* Twitter
* Facebook
* surface mail

To help with your planning, make sure each of these channels has a separate volume forecast.

These forecasts will either inform, or help to make, decisions on what technology you’ll use to route, handle, and store the historical data of these enquiries.

## Handling time: time it takes to deal with an enquiry

Work out the average handling time (AHT) and variance for each type of enquiry.

If you’re building AHT with deep historical data, you may be able to model the AHT separately for each kind of enquiry. Use the best historical data available to calculate the average number of enquiries per day a single agent can handle when dealing with a representative mix of enquiries types.


## Service level: how fast you respond to user enquiries

Work out the expected level of service that should be maintained by your helpdesk.

Generally, service level (SL or SLA) is worked out as x per cent of enquiries resolved in y time units. For example, you might plan to answer 80% of your incoming email enquiries in 24 hours.

You need to know the desired service level so you can work out how many agents you’ll need for your helpdesk. If your staffing is constrained by other factors, use this value as a constant and aim for the best service level that can be achieved at a certain volume level.


## Staffing and scheduling

You can only finalise your overall demand forecast and work out staff numbers when you have finished planning for:

* volume
* handling time
* service level

The same historical data you used to create your enquiry forecast will likely give you an idea of how the enquiries will be received throughout the planning period (likely a week). This will then help guide you on how to schedule your helpdesk staff, so they can achieve the service level you’ve planned for.

## Data collection and reporting

Once your helpdesk is operational and actually supporting users, collect data on all the areas you planned to collect information on. This data can then be used to:

* improve and refine the forecasts you made previously
* create long-term projections about the performance of your helpdesk

Plan on how to measure the performance of your helpdesk from the very beginning. Develop at least minimal reporting so you can evaluate the performance of:

* the group itself
* individual members of staff

## Going even further

These are good starting points to consider as and when you plan to develop new digital products and initiatives. There’s quite an extensive amount of online information that expands on the points made here, including some free planning tools. However, as with all areas of specialised knowledge, use the services of an experienced analyst rather than depending entirely on online sources for guidance.
