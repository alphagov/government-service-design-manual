## Where services live on the web

Every digital service offered by the UK government must have a single, well-known place on the web where users can locate and use the service. For public-facing services that will be the relevant start page on GOV.UK -- for instance, the DVLA’s vehicle tax service is at https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax.

Service Managers must not advertise any URL other than that of the GOV.UK start page as the starting point for the relevant service. This is what gets advertised, whether digitally or in other media.

The start page URL for a given service will be allocated by GDS based on discussions with the Service Manager and analysis of user behaviour, search referrals and other relevant data.

The service itself will be provided on a URL of the form www.{service-name}.service.gov.uk.

### Internal services, intranets and extranets

Services designed for an internal audience should also live on a domain of the form {service-name}.service.gov.uk but do not need a start and end page on GOV.UK.

> The Cabinet Office runs a service for those involved in the Controls processes. That is not a public facing service so does not have a start page on GOV.UK, but as a new government service it lives on the relevant service.gov.uk domain.
