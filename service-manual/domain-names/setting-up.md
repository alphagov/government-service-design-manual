## Getting a domain name and start/end pages

To make sure that the right user journey is set up for a new service it’s important that you engage with the GOV.UK team within GDS early.

When your service is close to launching to the general public (as a beta or fully live) you can start the process of getting a service domain name and start/end pages.

###Getting a service sub-domain

Start the service domain name process by emailing [gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) who will discuss with you the best name for your service domain.

Once your service has an agreed domain name, GDS will delegate control of your service sub-domain.

You can arrange delegation by sending the following information to the GDS Infrastructure Team ([dns-naming@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:dns-naming@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)):

1. Service name, e.g. {service-name}.service.gov.uk
2. DNS servers to delegate to (ask your technical team to see the [guidance on DNS delegation](/service-manual/domain-names/how-they-work)
3. Date you need it by (at least 5 working days notice)
4. Confirmation that your service has passed a Digital by Default service assessment or self-certification

###Getting start/end pages

The single point of contact for your department (or parent department for your agency) can help you request start/end pages from the GDS Content Team.

You’ll need to give a brief description of your service, including:

1. What the service is and who it’s for
2. What user needs it addresses
3. Eligibility criteria and restrictions
4. Anything else users need to know before using the service
5. A preview of the service (if available)
