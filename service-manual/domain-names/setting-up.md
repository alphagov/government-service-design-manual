## Getting a domain name and start/end page

To make sure that the right user journey (appropriate start/end pages, clear domain names) are set up
for a new service it's important that you engage with the GOV.UK team within GDS early.

If you're not already in conversation with the team about your service, you can start the process by e-mailing
gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

Once your service has an agreed name, you will need to supply the following information to your GDS contact who will put you in touch with the GDS Infrastructure Team to arrange delegation.

1. Service name e.g. {service-name}.service.gov.uk
2. DNS servers to delegate to (ask your technical team for these)
3. Date you need it by (at least 5 working days notice)
