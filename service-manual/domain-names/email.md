## Handling email

Emails to users of your service should be sent from a human-monitored email address that originates from the
domain servicename.service.gov.uk (and not the dept/agency or any other domain name). Users are interacting
with the service and that is where they will expect communications to come from.

### Getting emails to users

In order to protect users from spam email providers put in place a variety of checks. It is often a good idea
to use a trusted specialist third-party to dispatch email as they will have tools and expertise to help ensure
that you pass those checks. As a minimum you should:

* ensure there is a [mail exchanger (MX) record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) set up for the domain from which you send email
* enable [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) on the sending domain
* consider using [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) on the sending domain, it can provide additional guarantees about message delivery and help recipients to distinguish genuine mail from forgery

Before releasing your service you should test your email delivery. As a minimum you should use your service with
registered email addresses from a range of popular email providers and ensure that emails arrive as you expect.
