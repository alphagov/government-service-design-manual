Many public services require the user to prove their identity as an early and necessary step to accessing government services.  

The Identity Assurance Service will provide a simple, secure way for people to access public services on GOV.UK.

The service is currently being prototyped. The Identity Assurance Programme (IDAP) team is working closely with several government departments, and a beta identity assurance service will be available from late 2013 to support one or two beta digital services.

##The Identity Assurance Service

The Identity Assurance Service, developed by the IDAP within the Government Digital Service (GDS) will be the default service for all government departments providing public digital services which require identity assurance.

You should be working closely with IDAP to ensure that your identity assurance solution is aligned with IDAPs cross-government platform.

##How does it work?

IDAP is implementing an Identity Assurance Service that allows a user to authenticate themselves via an identity provider (IdP). IdPs are private sector organisations certified against government standards. They will perform checks to confirm the user’s identity and then assert that identity to the government department via the Identity Assurance Service platform.

In practice, this will mean that users of services will be prompted to log in using a third party while completing a transaction with government. If they log in successfully, and the IdP can assert that user’s identity, then the user will be able to complete that transaction.

The Identity Assurance Service is about ‘who the user is’ not 'what the user is entitled to’. The government department is responsible for determining entitlement. 

##Levels of assurance

The government department determines the level of assurance (LoA) they require for the digital service.

**LoA 1** is used when a government department needs to know that it is the same user returning to the service but does not need to know who that user is.

**LoA 2** is used when a government department needs to know who the user is and that that they are a real person to a sufficient level of confidence to be offered in support of civil proceedings

**LoA 3** is used when a government department requires to know who the user is and that that they are a real person to a sufficient level of confidence to be offered in support of criminal proceedings.
