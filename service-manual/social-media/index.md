## The case for social media

This year, Facebook has over a billion users (200 million of them only access the channel through mobile), YouTube is now more popular than cable television, every second 8000 users like a picture on Instagram and Twitter has over 288 million active monthly users globally - with the[ 55-64 age demographic being the fastest growing](http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-social-media-stats-2013/).

*[" The traffic potential of the social Web is far beyond what most media sites recognize. We all might think we understand Facebook and Twitter's power to drive traffic. But it turns out that when you actually create content specifically meant for those networks --particularly Facebook -- they drive vastly more traffic than ever seemed possible."* ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/12/zimmerman-graph-800x512.jpg)

[Ezra Klein ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/12/zimmerman-graph-800x512.jpg)

Social media is everywhere, it's becoming more and more a part of how we live our lives today and as government we can't afford to miss the incredible opportunities it affords us. From open policy making through to customer service and consumer insight social media is a valuable tool for the public sector. 

A playbook, by definition, is "[ a notional range of possible tactics in any sphere of activity](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/playbook)" and that’s what we’re trying to share here.

It outlines:

* how we at GDS use social media
* what we’ve grown to understand as best practise for the channels we use
* what we've learned
* what we're planning to do in the future

We’re hoping it will serve as a resource for anyone managing social media for UK government. It’s not a definitive article, as a good social media strategy will always be bespoke to individual needs. 

We talk first about how we listen, creation of a content strategy and general social tips and later outline our per channel approach. This is the first iteration of this document but given the ever changing social landscape there will be many more to come.

The GDS approach to social media, is the same as the overall GDS approach:  [simpler, clearer, faster](https://www.gov.uk/). Our focus remains fixed on meeting user needs.

We're not interested in campaigns with dancing ponies (although we think they’re great). We're interested in connecting with the people who care about what we're doing, sharing the learnings from the work that we do, and helping our users as promptly and effectively as we can.

## Defining Objectives

These may change over time, but your objectives will underpin your entire social strategy and inform your KPIs and all social activity, so it’s really important to have them defined before you go any further.

You’ll probably have a few overall objectives, which will help you create channel specific strategies. (For example, you probably won't be using Instagram as a primary means of dealing with customer service). Our initial objectives for GDS were to raise awareness and improve services. These led us to creating strategies based around warming up the social tone of voice, appealing to a wider audience, and sharing more relevant third party content.

We’ll talk later about how we used content to achieve these goals.

## Listening

One of the first things that social media is good for, is listening, you can't become part of a community - and you definitely can't hope to lead it - without being able to identify who your community are. Although this seems like the most obvious statement in the world, it's worth repeating as it's often forgotten.

### Listening should always be your step one

With the maelstrom of noise out there it's difficult to pick out the voices of your potential community in the crowd without the help of some dedicated software to do just this.

There are a myriad of options out there, all offering different specifications, and the truth is it's an entirely personal decision based on what your objectives are. 

At GDS we use [SproutSocial ](http://sproutsocial.com/)as it suits not just our monitoring needs, but also our social media management needs (more on this later). It allows us to set continual searches so we can see all mentions of whichever keywords or hashtags we decide upon.

![How we use Sprout Social](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/sprout-social.png)

Alongside social media monitoring software we also use* **[Mentio*n](https://en.mention.net) to monitor talk about GDS outside of social media - think of it like a super-charged real time Google Alerts.

## Audience Insight

Once you know who your community are / who you'd like them to be, it's important to find out as much as you can about them to ensure you're creating content that they'll be receptive to.

At GDS we use a combination of tools to fulfil this goal. 

![How we use Socialbro](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/social-bro.png)

[Socialbro](http://www.socialbro.com/) is a fantastic and easy to manage way of learning about your audience. When they're online, the hashtags that they respond to, the links that they're sharing and the things that they tweet about. 

We also learn about our community through SproutSocial, where we can see how many (if any) times that they've interacted with us and what age and gender they are. 

For example: 

Our @gdsteam followers as you might expect tend towards an 18-35 male demographic. We know how to keep these people engaged, they are, after all representative of the bulk of the tech community. We realised that we needed to speak to more women, so we added "Women in Tech" as one of the pillars of our content strategy.

The better a picture you have of your community the better you can serve them.

### Channels you should use

At GDS we manage 3 different Twitter accounts, YouTube and Vimeo accounts. Vine and Instagram and a Flickr account. A basic Google+ account (for future hangouts) and a LinkedIn channel. 

Is there any need for us to have this much social output? 

Yes!

Each channel appeals to a different type of person and a different type of content. What works on Linked In may not work on Instagram and vice versa. It’s about reaching your audience in all the places they already are, and sometimes in the places they are yet to be.

When you’re deciding which channels to use, think long and hard about the type of content you’re currently creating and where your audience lives, this will guide you as to where you need to be. It’s also worth re-enforcing that you should make sure you have the resource to run the channels you select. They need monitoring and regular posting. Running one channel well, is better than running 5 channels when you have the time.

## Creating a content strategy

Now you're learning about your community, it's time to devise a map for how you're going to communicate with them.  This part is easier if you have a some historical data about how different types of posts have performed on each platform. If not, don’t worry, we have information later in the playbook about which content we’ve found effective on each channel that you can use as a starting point.

![Content pillars for GDS social media strategy](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/content-pillars.png)

The above is a map of the content pillars we use at GDS to inform all our social activity. We ensure that all the content we share falls into at least one of the categories. The more categories content falls into, the more heavily we weight it against our [best times to tweet](http://www.socialbro.com/best-time-tweet)

We came up with these pillars based on a combination of things we think are important, things we know from analytics our followers appreciate and gaps we saw in our user demographics.

## Accountability

At GDS, we’re firm believers in accountability on the web. Once you start using social media to talk to your community and spread your story, you become accountable. Social media is a two way street. It makes no sense to use the channels to simply broadcast. You have to take part in the conversation, especially so when people are asking you questions. If you don’t have the resource to answer enquiries, then you don’t have the resource to use the channel. 

## Social Customer Service

More and more, people are turning to social media to air their grievances or to ask for help with a service, and [predictions for next year ](http://oursocialtimes.com/5-social-customer-service-predictions-for-2014/) show that these numbers are going to continue to grow steadily.

Currently [71% of customers who experience a quick and effective response from a brand ](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2013/07/the-social-customer.html) are likely to recommend that brand to others. According to a study done by American Express the average number of people a social customer will tell about a good experience is 43, but for a bad experience it’s 52.  [32% of social customers expect a response within 30 minutes, with 42% expecting a response within 60 minutes.](http://www.viralblog.com/social-media/social-media-and-customer-service/)

Now, we’re aware that government isn’t a brand, but providing quick and effective service should be the goal for everyone. Alongside just being helpful, it’s imperative for building trust within your community, and helping to position yourselves as leaders.

At GDS we aim to provide an initial response to all enquiries within 4 working hours. Sprout Social makes it easy to track response time and rate for all the members of your team with their [Engagement Report](http://updates.sproutsocial.com/post/44633629122/introducing-the-engagement-report) which allows you to easily see which gaps need filling.

It’s important when considering customer service to ensure that you can receive direct messages from all users. Since this is a relatively new function, you have to switch it on 

yourself, and directions of how to do so can be found[ here](http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/15/twitter-direct-messages-all-followers/).

## When and How to Respond

Sometimes it’s difficult to know what kind of social interactions demand a response and if they do, which kind of response is appropriate.

We always try and respond to @messages on Twitter - unless they’re just people name checking us. (As an aside, we’ve got the internal team hashtagging #GDSTeam instead of @messaging. 400+ people talking about their workplace daily creates a lot of noise to filter out.) That response doesn’t always have to be public, if someone says something nice or smart about you, a [favourite](https://support.twitter.com/articles/14214-what-is-a-favorite) does the job of telling them that you liked it, without having to send thanks @messages all day long.

There’s no need to respond to RTs (unless you want to thank an influencer) and we avoid retweeting positive tweets about ourselves unless they add value to our community.

## Dealing with Detractors

It is unfortunately a fact, that as soon as you become active on social media, there are going to be people who aren’t happy about it. These aren’t to be confused with people who have valid complaints or questions. Instead they are people who continually talk about your account in a derogatory fashion for no good reason. 

There are a number of ways to deal with these people. 

Firstly create a "Rules of Conduct" for your Facebook page  ([Converse](https://www.facebook.com/notes/converse/house-rules/330730391922) have a great example of this) - this isn’t quite as easy for a Twitter account, although you can host the rules elsewhere. 

We have different rules for the different accounts we manage (see more about this later in building an escalation policy).

For example, when dealing with detractors on @GOVUK we will always try to help on the first message. If this person continues to tweet at us 5 or more times without engaging with our offer of help, we will block them. 

## Banning people on Facebook

We don’t currently use Facebook, but the same principles apply. If someone breaks your house rules, you have every right to ban them from your page. You can take a lot of the trouble out of this by setting up a [Moderation blocklist](https://www.facebook.com/help/331310093617829/). This allows you to block comments containing certain words from ever appearing on your page.

## Escalation Policy

If things do begin to get out of hand - an up to date escalation document is a really helpful tool to manage the "crisis". Social bakers have just blogged about theirs: [http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/2100-5-things-you-must-have-in-your-social-media-crisis-plan](http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/2100-5-things-you-must-have-in-your-social-media-crisis-plan) 

Our escalation policy outlines how to define what classifies as problematic (10 tweets, 100 tweets or more) and who should be contacted in each instance. (Is this something that demands a press office response, or can it be handled in team?) Creating one of these shouldn’t be used as a safety net for posting controversial content, but it will help you in quickly and appropriately responding to the situation.

## Our KPIs

* User growth
* Engagement
* Amplification (RTs)
* Clicks
* Favourites
* how long it takes **_us_** to answer tweets

![KPIs for how well your social media engagement is doing](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/twitter-stats.png)

Much of this information is acquired from Sprout Social (learn about how this works from an[ impartial source](http://socialmediatoday.com/johndsaunders/1313601/sprout-social-social-media-management-tool-2013)).

We create weekly and monthly reports highlighting these figures, the most popular content and what we’ve learned that month. This goes on to inform our next month’s content planning.

Alongside tracking the number of users that follow us, we also keep an eye on the number that unfollow us. (Social bro offers this information in their [follower retention](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/03/17/should_women_negotiate_for_more_pay_a_female_academic_leans_in_and_allegedly.html) report.)  Over time we can create a baseline metric from the numbers, which allows us to see if certain times of the week /day / pieces of content create more unfollows.

We are, of course interested in growing our community, but we’re more interested in ensuring our existing community are listened to and that the content that we’re providing is engaging and helpful. 

## Social Media and Storytelling

For brands, social media is all about crafting a story for your fans and advocates to buy into, thus (hopefully) ensuring increased sales and loyalty. For government it’s a little bit different in that we’re not selling anything, or asking people to give us anything, in fact, in many cases our "users" have no choice but to interact with us.

However, we want our users to understand what we’re doing, and why we’re doing it as well as asking them for feedback. So our storytelling *must* be focussed on transparency.

At GDS our story is about online services and digital transformation, so that’s at the heart of what we share. Information about the services, how they’re built, who was involved, the various iterations. 

[Blogging](/service-manual/communications/blogs) is an incredibly important way that we can share stories. We encourage all the teams within GDS to blog updates on their [team blogs](https://blog.gov.uk/), while we reserve the [main GDS blog](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) for the bigger stories with broader appeal. 

## Setting up a creative team / Adopting the agency model

Having a team dedicated to running the social channels and creating content to tell people about the services we’re building is incredibly helpful. This team doesn’t have to be huge, someone with some content creation skills, a social media manager and some design resource would be optimum. We’ve found that it’s important to dedicate time and resource to creating content specifically for social, not just tweeting links to speeches or press releases. Great social content will drive more traffic than almost anything else. 

It’s also important to remember that it’s not all about chasing clicks! If you can tell your story in 140 characters, or with an image or a short video (and no supporting blog post / press release) then all the better. 

## Creating an Editorial Calendar

We use Basecamp for our project management within the Digital Engagement and Design teams, using the various tools available within Basecamp we created a calendar that all of the projects feed into so we can see all of the social and media activity we have planned as an organisation.

The one thing missing from this was something to tie the things we were doing to things that were happening in the real outside world. We used sites like [http://www.awarenessdays.co.uk/](http://www.awarenessdays.co.uk/)  to look at upcoming events to see if we had any content that might lend itself to them. 

For example, we noticed it was World Poetry Day and realised TfL had a Poems on the Underground page we could link to, so we tweeted from @GOVUK and were delighted when @LandRegGov responded with a poem for us.

![Poem from Land Registry to GOV.UK](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/poetry-tweet.png)

The key thing to remember about editorial tie ins, is that you must have content that adds something to the user. A rule of thumb for us when we’re tweeting from @GOVUK is that it points back to something on www.GOV.UK

## Sourcing Content

At GDS we have a lot of output from our multiple blogs / videos and content crafted specifically for social, so we’ve flipped the [70/30 content rule](http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-70-30-rule_b49003) so we’re creating 70% and curating the other 30% of our content. It’s important to share curated content for a number of reasons, these include:

Not just talking about ourselves. No one wants to hear this.

Showing that we live in the real world.

Demonstrating that we understand the digital space we occupy.

## Where we find our content

Now that we’re equipped with our content grid we can easily identify the types of things we should be sharing. We find these primarily through our RSS reader, [Feedly](http://feedly.com/i). You can easily add the blogs you know you want to subscribe to, and Feedly also offers you suggestions based on areas like tech or social or anything you’d like to search for. (It also integrates with Sprout for even easier sharing.) Our feedly includes blogs from each of the 6 content pillars and all the blogs on the GOV.UK blogging platform.

We ask our colleagues across GDS to share anything they think would be appropriate with us, and we collate these links in a shared [Pocket ](http://getpocket.com/)account. 

## Scheduling

We talked previously about knowing our best times to tweet with the help of Social bro. We can use this information to schedule content ahead of time. ([Sprout Social offers this feature](http://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-publishing)) It’s useful if you’re not going to be around or you want to schedule at the weekend (weekend posts often drive higher engagement if timed correctly) but keep in mind that you’re going to need to moderate what you’ve posted. 

If you’re not using Sprout then Buffer app is a good option for scheduling content (it also offers some analytics) and it works with LinkedIn and Facebook too.

## The channels

### Twitter

Currently the bulk of all our social activity takes place on Twitter, we use 3 different accounts and are looking to establish another one in Spring 2014. With the exception of LinkedIn and Pinterest all the other channels play a supporting role to Twitter. We chose this as our platform of choice for a number of reasons;

Firstly, the demographic swings towards[ younger,more tech savvy users](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/04/tech/social-media/twitter-news-study/?hpt=zite_zite4_featured) these people are more likely to engage with and share our content. 

Alongside this, the biggest growth on Twitter is currently in the 55-64 bracket so we’re able to talk to a wide variety of our users. 

After doing some web wide research, we learned that almost 95% of the talk about GOV.UK is taking place on Twitter anyway.

Also, Twitter doesn’t [use an algorithm](http://blog.bufferapp.com/understanding-facebook-news-feed-algorithm) to [decide which of your content](http://gigaom.com/2013/03/07/facebook-vs-twitter-how-do-you-like-your-social-news-feed-filtered-or-unfiltered/) makes it to your followers. It’s up to you to learn which content works best when.

There are a few services offered by Twitter that can prove especially useful for the public sector:

#### Twitter Alerts

Earlier this year, Twitter announced [Alerts](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/introducing-twitter-alerts), a new breaking news service available to certain local, national and international institutions that provide critical information to the general public. (The service is only available to people using the official Twitter app for iPhone or Android.)  GOV.UK is currently on the waiting list for this service but [@FCOTravel](https://twitter.com/FCOtravel) and [@Envagency](https://twitter.com/EnvAgency) are already using the service, you can learn more about it [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fco-sign-up-to-twitter-alerts-service).

#### Getting Verified on Twitter

When communicating with people on Twitter it’s important that they can trust that you’re the official voice of your department. One of the easiest ways to do this is to ensure your account is verified. (You can identify verified accounts by the blue tick on their profile.)  Details on how to do this can be found on the [Twitter site](https://support.twitter.com/articles/119135-faqs-about-verified-accounts). 

![GDS on Twitter](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/verified-twitter-account.png)

We’re not planning on writing a Twitter guidebook as there are many already available online, one of the most inclusive coming from [Mashable](http://mashable.com/guidebook/twitter/). Instead we’ll talk about techniques we’ve found have worked for us, and how use them.

#### How GDS do Twitter

* When tweeting ensure all links are shortened and tracked with [Bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or another URL shortener, that provides information about clicks
* Links go 25% of the way through the tweet if possible ([this gives far higher CTR](http://danzarrella.com/new-twitter-data-optimal-link-placement-for-clicks.html#))
* Keep tweets short, [under 100 characters](https://business.twitter.com/best-practices) gets up to 17% higher engagement
* When sharing visuals, share with Twitter pic or Flickr for [higher engagement](http://www.peterstringer.com/2013/11/embed-images-not-instagram-links-for-more-twitter-engagement/) than Instagram. 
* When sharing video and images from Flickr [use the existing Flickr functionality](http://www.flickr.com/help/sharing/) to ensure inline image display
* Use hashtags (as part of the text) when relevant but *never* more than two, and keep these short as well!
* When RT-ing through Sprout Social, always choose the "Quote tweet" option from the dropdown, this allows you to edit the tweet (MT) and track the link
* When using hashtags try and keep the tweet character count as low as possible to allow followers to contextualise the RT without the tag dropping off
* Don’t use hashtags if they’re not going to add anything
* If you are using hashtags for a specific event, make sure there’s only one and actively promote this
* Use Twitter like a real person! See something funny that is important in your stream? RT it. Read a tweet that makes you laugh? Favourite it. But please always bear in mind the [civil service guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-conduct-and-guidance)
* Don’t be afraid of the occasional exclamation mark or emoticon. Your tone should be appropriate to the space you’re in
* [80% of UK Twitter users access Twitter via mobile](https://blog.twitter.com/en-gb/2014/80-of-uk-users-access-twitter-via-their-mobile), bear this in mind when you’re creating content. No one wants to view a huge infographic on a phone screen.

### GDS Guide to Instagram

Get involved in things that are already happening on Instagram, for example #tbt (ThrowBackThursday) is a great place to re-use older content.

Hashtags rule on Instagram, but please don’t go crazy. 3 is more than enough.

Keep Instagram photos smartphone only - it’s what the channel was designed for. HD images live elsewhere (probably on Flickr).

However, it’s fine to upload 15 seconds of edited video to Instagram. 

At GDS we use Instagram as a tool to add a different type of content to our Twitter output, to humanise the team, for real time updates, and for experimenting with video.

Instagram is also incredibly handy for adding images into the live tweeting mix (although since Instagram removed Twitter cards, you’ll have to have the IFTTT recipe switched on to ensure people are seeing them: [https://ifttt.com/recipes/136260-instagram-to-twitter](https://ifttt.com/recipes/136260-instagram-to-twitter))

Up until very recently it was impossible to schedule Instagram posts, but with the advent of start up Schedugram: [http://schedugr.am/](http://schedugr.am/) it’s now a reality.

### Flickr

#### How we Use Flickr

We love Flickr for hosting HD images, and as a valuable image resource internally when creating presentations. It’s also great for creating albums which can then be shared to Twitter and display inline.  To celebrate the first birthday of GOV.UK we created a series of whiteboard graphics based around things we’d learned about our users over the previous 12 months. We called it #userfacts and shared one each day for the week leading up to the birthday. We then tweeted the entire photo set on the day as an inline display.


![How we use Flickr](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/gds-flickr-userfacts.png)

#### Best Practice

As more hashtag search engines are appearing every day, Flickr content is becoming more likely to be pulled into their results. This means it’s more important than ever to make sure that all content is correctly titled and tagged. You can add as many tags as you like to Flickr as there’s no limit and it doesn’t negatively impact the user experience. 

Flickr have produced their own very comprehensive *[Best Practice for Organisation*s](http://www.flickr.com/bestpractices/) document.

#### Creating Sets

Crafting your images into sets not only allows users to easily find the content that they’re looking for, it also allows you to share lovely looking photosets direct to Twitter. Remember that the copy you write for the set will appear in line with your tweet and photos.

### YouTube

Some things to bear in mind

* [Sharing YouTube videos direct to Twitter](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57741?hl=en) and LinkedIn allows the media to play "in line " requiring no further clicks
* Video playlist creation can work for government too. For example, we’re currently working on "everything you need to know about GDS in 10 minutes" as an introduction for new starters
* Allowing others to embed your material boosts views
* Sharing videos of tutorials / presentations in blogs increases engagement
* Aggregation of  third party content - sometimes someone else has already done it well. (There’s no point in reinventing the wheel)
* Ensure as content is uploaded title and tags are added (SEO friendly please!)
* Add content to the relevant playlists
* Use [video annotations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/92710?topic=14354&hl=en) when necessary (these are great for directing traffic to web URLS or encouraging subscriptions)
* Upload regularly - stagnant accounts indicate to your community that you can’t be bothered
* Bear in mind that YouTube has a longer viewing half life than most social channels, add this to your monitoring
* [40% of YouTube views come from mobile](http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/youtube-goes-mobile/), optimise for this
* Always add a CTA (Call To Action) to the description or the text you’re adding to share. "Watch" and “Video” are two of the most clicked links on Twitter

![How we use Youtube](/service-manual/assets/images/social-media/youtube.png)

Something to remember when uploading videos to YouTube for public consumption, is *accessibility*. To ensure that everyone can get the most from your videos, it’s** imperative **they’re either captioned, or embedded with a transcript (we can’t publish them if they don’t meet these requirements).

### Vimeo

We’re using vimeo primarily as a video archive, and a way of sharing videos before they’re published (users with the required[ URL and password](https://vimeo.com/help/faq/managing-your-videos/privacy-settings) can login and watch / download videos). This is really helpful for the sign off process when teams are working remotely.

### Linked In

[GDS has a Company Page on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/government-digital-service), on which we share video updates and link to relevant pages on our blog. We’ve found that our updates on LinkedIn actually result in a higher click through / engagement rate than on our other channels.

A little while ago LinkedIn announced [Showcase pages](http://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ms/company-pages/showcase-pages.html) for companies. This will allow different pages for different areas / departments with more specific targeting and multiple admins, so we’re in the process of rewriting our LinkedIn strategy to accommodate this.

### Facebook

GDS team don’t have a Facebook page, initially, this was a matter of resource. But as time progresses, [with every new update to the Newsfeed algorithm](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-facebook-news-feed-works-2014-2?) it becomes increasingly difficult to get your content seen unless you’re willing to pay for it.

## General Profile Hygiene

Make sure your profiles are all filled out and kept updated. 

Make sure your image pics and backgrounds are consistent. Standing Dog published a really useful list of all the image dimensions you could need[ here](http://www.standingdog.com/blog/50-social-media-image-dimensions/).

## This is an alpha

As this playbook is an alpha, and social media is an ever expanding space, you can expect updates in these areas over the coming months.

Pinterest, blogging on GOV.UK , building a community, identifying and working with influencers, how we do outreach, and social support for live events.
