Really understanding who your users are, understanding their needs and maintaining a close focus on designing digital services that best meet their needs is an ongoing struggle again our internal processes and domain knowledge. Regular user research helps to make sure that we start and stay aligned with real user needs.

## How user researchers work

User researchers are involved at all phases of the project and work closely and collaboratively with designers and product owners.
In the early stages of discovery they assist in developing a clear understanding and empathy for end users, making sense of existing research and commissioning or conducting additional research.

Through the Alpha and Beta phases they work closely with the design team to provide guidance based on their understanding of end user needs and behaviour, and working with the team to design methods to answer outstanding questions about the users and the design of the service being created.

As a member of the delivery team, you should hire researchers who are comfortable working in an agile team, delivering continuous research in fortnightly iterations. Especially in alpha and beta phases, you will get better results by bringing a researcher into your team rather than outsourcing research to 3rd party. In particular you should look for a researcher who has experience contributing to other disciplines in the team. Capabilities in design or content are particularly helpful.

In product development a mixture of experience in both qualitative and quantitative research is useful, although the most essential will be the ability to design and conduct qualitative research. Teams should aim to observe real users interacting with the product they are designing at least every two weeks, most often in the form of one-on-one interviews.

## How to hire researchers

When hiring a user researcher there are two main things to consider.

Firstly consider whether they have sufficient experience in designing, facilitating and analysing user research, in particular one-on-one interviews and usability testing. A researcher with hours of experience observing end users interacting with digital products can bring value to the design team immediately. Most experienced researchers should be able to provide you with an estimate of their total hours of experience observing users and, on request, provide video clips showing examples of their facilitation techniques for you to review. You are looking for a researcher who has 100+ hours of facilitation experience and who demonstrates an empathetic yet methodical approach to facilitation.

Secondly, consider their ability to work well in an agile team. This means that they need to be able to work collaboratively with designers and product owners, to be flexible and responsive in designing research and comfortable with a fast moving work environment where change is constant, and most importantly, they need to have experience and ability in quickly and effectively communicating research insights in an actionable way so that these insights actively shape the design and development of the product. This will usually mean that the researcher has exercised some creativity and experimentation in their method of communicating findings and they should be able to share examples that were more and less successful.
