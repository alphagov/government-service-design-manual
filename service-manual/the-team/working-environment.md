Working spaces for digital projects will vary, but there are some things you can do to ensure that the space you have available can be used in the way your team needs.

## What you might encounter

Those working in creative and technical fields often need plenty of space for focused, detailed work. It's not uncommon to see people spending a significant chunk of their day with headphones on to help them focus, or locked in conversation with just one person with whom they're pairing.

Equally, you might expect to see lots of short meetings throughout a day, often around walls covered in notes or reference material. These regular exchanges are important to ensure the quality of the work, but can seem strange in office cultures that are much more used to formal meetings or conference calls.

## Hacking the environment

The room a team works in is a tool. It is just as important as the choice of project management tools or choice of programming language.

Teams should dedicate time at the beginning of a project to making sure they have everything they need and addressing any problems. This might include setting up a project wall, configuring collaboration software like email groups or project trackers, building and installing dashboards, putting up whiteboards, or simply moving desks about so the team can sit together.

Removing those dividers between desks makes a big difference and allows conversation between the team to flow more freely. If large monitors are getting in the way remove them.

You might also want to think about getting [desk tidies like these](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=9&Sub=38&PID=163). The difference a tidy environment makes to ability of a team to think and work is striking.

This process is known as 'hacking the environment'.

## Sit together

This might seem like an obvious one, but teams working together to deliver a product should sit close together. Short, informal conversations are an important way to test assumptions, and this gets much harder when a team is distributed across an office, or worse, in different buildings.

## Communication tools

When working on the design, development and operation of a service it's essential that your team be able to be in constant contact with one another to make rapid decisions, provide support and information and to ensure everyone's aware of the project as a whole.

Some of that will be achieved through regular short meetings such as a daily standup or weekly 'show and tell' session, but there's also a need for an asynchronous mechanism that's more immediate and conversational than email but that allows people to dip in and out.

[Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC) -- and similar tools such as group messengers, [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/), and so on -- operate as software running on the user's computer as a dedicated application or in a web browser, supporting a constant stream of live conversation. Typically, a user would leave the service running in the background while working on other things, switching focus when a break is needed or when you need to ask a specific question. Questions might be along the lines of:

>* 'Has anyone else encountered this bug in our search component?'
>* 'Is anyone else working on the main dashboard template?'
>* 'Does anyone know how to configure this server to support more connections?'

Anyone on the team would be able to respond with information, suggestions of other people to talk to, and so on. Because it is network based it will also work regardless of geography so distributed teams can continue to communicate as if they were in one room.
