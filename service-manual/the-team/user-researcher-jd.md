## Job description

The governmentâ€™s approach to digital and IT puts user needs at the heart of decision making. User Researchers are therefore key figures in [service teams](/service-manual/the-team.html), working to generate the feedback and insight service teams need to build a clear picture of their users and deliver solutions that they need.  They will support [service managers](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html) by generating new and useful user insights and translating it into features and actions that will allow them to iteratively improve their service for users.

You will be experienced in using a variety of [user testing](/service-manual/users/introduction-to-user-research.html) methodologies to reveal actionable customer insights.

* working with Service Managers to devise appropriate research strategies to generate focused insights and to convert concepts into high quality stimulus material
* working closely with designers and developers to turn user data into actionable product/service requirements that feed into prototype development, and influence product direction
* Designing, scripting and analysing ad-hoc quantitative surveys using in-house software licences
* Managing ad-hoc qualitative/quantitative research projects such as proposition development, visual identity and customer experience mapping
* applying knowledge in human factors, ethnography, and the user-centered design process to product and service design in an iterative development environment
* presenting findings and related design/business recommendations and customer insights to senior decision makers
