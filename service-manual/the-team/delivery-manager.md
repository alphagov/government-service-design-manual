The delivery manager sets the team up for successful delivery. Remove obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how it’s done.

## The importance of delivery managers

Skilled delivery managers remove obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how it’s done. It’s not about micro managing!

Equally important in an agile team -- and particularly important to the delivery manager -- is ongoing effort to improve products, services or processes. Their role in this is to facilitate project meetings- including daily [stand-ups](/service-manual/agile/features-of-agile.html), [sprint planning meetings](/service-manual/agile/features-of-agile.html), and [retrospectives](/service-manual/agile/running-retrospectives.html). They also track progress and produce artefacts for showing this, like burn down/up charts. They must be able to enable the team to produce estimates of how much effort is required to produce features that the [Product Manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html) wants.
