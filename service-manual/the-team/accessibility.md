Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility. Provide training and resources to help your team build accessibility into everything they do. That includes planning, designing, building and managing.

## Accessibility leads

Include at least one person with strong accessibility knowledge in your team. Give them overall responsibility for educating and supporting your team’s accessibility goals.

The key skills required by an accessibility-focused developer are:

* strong analytical skills
* a methodical approach to testing
* empathy for users with different, often contradictory needs
* an in-depth knowledge of modern accessible development best-practices
* the ability to communicate at all levels

Accessible, usable products are the heart of everything we do at the GDS. Your service needs to be just as thoughtful to the needs of all possible users so that no one is excluded on the basis of disability.
