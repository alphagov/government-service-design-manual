GDS is creating a highly practical induction and development programme to help you as a new service manager.

We're developing the programme iteratively with discovery, alpha and beta phases, moving into live from autumn 2013.

As a participant, you’ll be in a group of six to eight service managers and will commit 10 days to the programme over the course of a month.

While on the programme you will:

*  learn by doing
*  share your everyday achievements
*  discuss your challenges with people you can trust
*  become part of a supportive network of service managers across government

Back in your department you will be better able to:

*  advocate for digital by default
*  establish and track user-centred KPIs
*  model the right behaviours
*  get things done and operate your services effectively

The programme is constantly evolving to meet participants' needs, but the descriptions below give a flavour of the modules you're likely to cover. They're based on the things service managers told us they need to develop the most, and are led by GDS specialists in each area.

##Changing the game

###Putting users first

User-centred processes start with [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html), and so does this induction programme. In this session the group will:

*  meet some users of government digital services
*  explore different techniques for finding out what users need
*  write some user stories; and
*  decide what requirements count as user needs

###Digital leadership

Which principles of leadership can be brought to bear in the new era of agile digital services? Your group will:

*  find out how high achieving digital leaders get things done so you can model and demonstrate that behaviour in your department
*  hear war stories from someone who is a leader in the digital field
* take away tips and practical advice on digital leadership

###Being agile

[Agile](/service-manual/agile/what-agile-looks-like.html) runs through the Digital by Default Service Standard like the words through a stick of rock. Your group will:

*  unpack the tools and practices that make agile such a powerful method for delivering services
*  visit some of the agile teams working at Aviation House
*  consider the role of the service manager in agile delivery

##Achieving the goals

###Meeting the service standard

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/) is the benchmark your services must reach in order to be taken live on GOV.UK. You will:

*  learn about the standard, how it was created and what tools are available to help departments meet it
*  consider how services will be assessed against the standard
*  assess which parts of the standard are most challenging for your own services and department
*  identify development needs to help you and your department to meet the standard

###Building the team

As a service manager you need the support of a [multidisciplinary team](/service-manual/the-team/) working intensively together through rapid iterations. Your group will:

*  understand the roles needed in an agile, user-centred service re-design team
*  get to the heart of what job titles and descriptions really mean, so that your department can appoint the right people, and at the right levels
*  consider the team’s tools and working environments
*  identify specific development needs for yourself and your team members

###Getting things done in government

The right governance, processes and controls are essential for agile projects to succeed. Your group will:

*  share your experiences of what helps and hinders getting things done in government
*  see examples of where agile can unlock faster, better decision-making
*  consider how agile fits with departments’ existing processes and governance
*  identify support you need from your managers, teams, mentors and peers to move your projects through the delivery process

##Always improving

###KPIs: setting the bar

Your group will discuss how you set and measure key performance indicators for your services so that you can lead them in the right direction. Based on information you will prepare beforehand, you will:

*  share your service KPIs as they currently stand
*  consider what additional KPIs may be required for your services to measure satisfaction, success rates, cost per transaction and take-up
*  find out about the [Performance Platform](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform.html) and how you can use it
*  design your own performance dashboard to show KPIs for your services in a simple, visual way

###Always be testing

Continuous testing and [quality](/service-manual/agile/quality.html) is a central part of agile, user-centred service design. The group will hear from experts in different types of testing and analytics. You will:

*  find out about different types of testing, how and when they are best applied
*  interpret example test results and decide whether you would launch a service on the strength of them
*  learn how to try out new features and multiple design solutions with multivariate testing

###Design principles in action

A set of simple but powerful [design principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples) underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will:

*  discover the 10 design principles and how they were created
*  hear from a product manager who has used them on a project
*  consider how they will be applied to your own services

###Digital meets IT

To operate effectively, many new digital services must work alongside departments’ existing IT systems. In this session your group will:

*  hear from specialists in [technology architecture](/service-manual/technology/architecture.html)
*  learn about best practice in security, privacy and identity
*  hear how government is using open source and open standards to deliver more effective digital services
*  consider how to deliver effective digital services in the context of departments’ existing and planned IT systems

###Procure to improve

Delivering high quality digital services that improve continuously often depends on effective procurement. As a group you will:

*  consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development
*  discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions
*  hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations

###Increasing take-up

[Digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html) is one of the four KPIs that services must benchmark, measure and monitor to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. The group will:

*  hear from GDS specialists in digital take-up
*  consider barriers to adoption and how your services can overcome them
*  assess the impact of channel shift on non-digital processes

###Assisted digital

Most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help. This support is referred to as [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital). The group will discover:

*  who are the users who need assisted digital support
*  what good assisted digital support will look like
*  how departments and GDS are working together to develop assisted digital support approaches as part of overall service transformation
