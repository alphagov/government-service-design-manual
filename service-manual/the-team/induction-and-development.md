**Who should attend**

All newly appointed service managers should book to attend both the induction programme and all 3 days of the open programme.

More experienced service managers or others in specialist roles in government may choose to book onto any or all of the open programme modules.

All sessions will run at a central London location.

The programme is funded centrally, but you or your department will need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies.

#Induction programme

For newly appointed service managers, this aims to equip them with the basic knowledge, network and confidence to take the lead in transforming digital services.

The induction programme includes the following modules:

###Why are we here?

Together we’re leading the digital transformation of government, by making services so good people prefer to use them. This introductory session explores:

*  why we need to change the way government does digital
*  what has happened so far, including the launch of GOV.UK and adoption of the 25 exemplar transformations
*  what this means for agencies and departments in general and for the role of service manager in particular

###Putting users first

User-centred processes start with [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html), and so does this induction programme. In this session the group will:

*  meet some users of government digital services
*  explore different techniques for finding out what users need
*  write some user stories
*  decide what requirements count as user needs

###Digital leadership

Which principles of leadership can be brought to bear in the new era of agile digital services? Your group will:

*  find out how high achieving digital leaders get things done so you can model and demonstrate that behaviour in your department
*  hear war stories from someone who is a leader in the digital field
* take away tips and practical advice on digital leadership

###Thinking agile

[Agile](/service-manual/agile/index.html) marks a fundamental shift from traditional methods of delivery in government. This session will introduce agile thinking and show how it leads to better outcomes. You'll cover:

* agile as a mindset, much wider than a set of tools and techniques
* the principles to be found in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and how they apply to software projects and beyond
* the agile disciplines that keep teams focused on outcomes and maximise the chances of success

###Meeting the service standard

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/) is the benchmark your services must reach in order to be taken live on GOV.UK. You will:

*  learn about the standard, how it was created and what tools are available to help departments meet it
*  consider how services will be assessed against the standard
*  assess which parts of the standard are most challenging for your own services and department
*  identify development needs to help you and your department to meet the standard

###Building the team

As a service manager you need the support of a [multidisciplinary team](/service-manual/the-team/) working intensively together through rapid iterations. Your group will:

*  understand the roles needed in an agile, user-centred service re-design team
*  get to the heart of what job titles and descriptions really mean, so that your department can appoint the right people, and at the right levels
*  consider the team’s tools and working environments
*  identify specific development needs for yourself and your team members

###Technology for digital services

You may not be the most technical person on your team, but as service manager you cannot leave all the technology decisions to others. This session will cover:

* choosing technology, making it possible to change your mind and avoiding lock-in
* risk and risk management, and getting the whole team thinking about security
* questions to ask your development team to help them make the best technology decisions possible

###Make, test and learn

It's time to try out the methods and tools picked up on the programme so far. In this practical exercise your group will:

*  self-organise to respond to a real-life brief
*  discover user needs, write user stories and prototype solutions to meet them
*  test your solutions with target users and iterate based on what you learn

#Open programme

These 3 days contain more specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the Digital by Default Service Standard.

The open programme includes the following modules:

##Day 1

###KPIs: setting the bar

The group will discuss how to set and measure key performance indicators so you can lead your services in the right direction. Based on information you will prepare beforehand, you will:

* share your service KPIs as they currently stand

* consider what additional KPIs may be required for your services to measure satisfaction, success rates, cost per transaction and take-up

* find out about the [Performance Platform](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform.html) and how you can use it

* design your own performance dashboard to show KPIs for your services in a simple, visual way

###Increasing take-up

[Digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup.html) is one of the four KPIs that services must benchmark, measure and monitor to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. The group will:

* hear from GDS specialists in digital take-up

* consider barriers to adoption and how your services can overcome them

* assess the impact of channel shift on non-digital processes

###Assisted digital

Most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help. This support is referred to as [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital). The group will discover:

* who are the users who need assisted digital support

* what good assisted digital support will look like

* how departments and GDS are working together to develop assisted digital support approaches as part of overall service transformation

##Day 2

###Always be testing

Carry out user research in every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage - don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. You will find out how doing user research continuously will:

* keep your team concentrating on real user needs

* help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs 

* help teams iterate products in response to user feedback

###Design principles in action

A set of simple but powerful [design principles](/designprinciples) underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will:

* discover the 10 design principles and how they were created

* hear from a product manager who has used them on a project

* consider how they will be applied to your own services

###Identity assured

We need to know that users of digital services are who they say they are. In this session, you will learn how the Identity Assurance Programme is:

* creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers

* setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments

* building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers

* working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ identity assurance requirements and plan their transition to using the identity assurance service

##Day 3 

###Procure to improve

Delivering high quality digital services that improve continuously often depends on effective procurement. As a group you will:

* consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development

* discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions

* hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations

###Being agile

GDS delivery managers will lead discussions and exercises around key features of agile, such as:

* agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories

* sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible

* retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together

###Technology talks

GDS technical architects will give a series of short talks and Q&A sessions about important aspects of choosing and managing technology for digital services.
