Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines -- interaction, graphic, UX -- but a good digital service needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products.

## How designers work
Designers, user researchers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications.

As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it.

Depending on the types of project you are tackling you may require a team of designers with a range of different skills. A good first hire for a team tends to be a strong interaction designer, however adding designers with graphic design skills and designers who also have a background in undertaking user research can also give your team additional flexibility and capabilities.

We strongly believe that design and user experience is the responsibility of the entire team and must be considered from the outset of the project through to and beyond going live. UX includes how fast the servers are, to how the copy is written, to how the layout is implemented in code, and what the structure of the URLs is. It's worth looking at Frances Berriman's [talk on this](http://fberriman.com/2012/06/14/designing-better-user-experiences-txjs-2012/).

## How to hire designers

When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to explain their practical contribution. You should look for the designer to share stories and documentation that demonstrates how they have worked closely with other members of the team including developers, content designers, user researchers and stakeholders in an agile and iterative way.

When evaluating their design work, it is important that the designer can explain a strong rationale for their design decision making that is based in supporting user needs. This ability to explain their rationale convincingly is more important than their ability to show polished wireframes or designs in their portfolio. Often a lack of polished designs in a portfolio can indicate that a designer is highly collaborative or has strong development skills, so take care not to focus only on polished comps or layouts.

You should also ask the designer to talk about any significant differences between the design they present in their portfolio and the actual live design. It is important that designers create appropriate work and are able to persuade stakeholders and their team to make good design decisions.
