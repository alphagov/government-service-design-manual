#Who should take part

This one day workshop is a foundation for people who will work on digital services in accordance with the Digital by Default Service Standard. It covers the changing way government does digital, how we put users first in everything we do, the principles behind agile methodologies, and how services are assessed before they can go live on GOV.UK.

The day is suitable for people who are working on digital services. It is not recommended for newly appointed service managers, who should book to attend the [service manager induction programme](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/service-manager-induction) instead.

#What's covered

The foundation day is highly participative with group exercises and the chance to discuss good practice from a range of departments and agencies. By the end of the day participants will understand:

* Why government needs to change
* What has happened so far including the launch of GOV.UK and adoption of the 25 exemplar transformations
* What this means for your organisation and your role
* User needs -- what they are, how to identify them, and how to use them to drive service delivery
* Agile as a mindset, its principles and disciplines and how that keeps teams focussed on outcomes
* The Digital by Default Service Standard -- how it was created, what are your department's gaps, and how can you meet them.

The day includes the following modules:

###Why are we here?

Together we’re leading the digital transformation of government, by making services so good people prefer to use them. This introductory session explores:

*  why we need to change the way government does digital
*  what has happened so far, including the launch of GOV.UK and adoption of the 25 exemplar transformations
*  what this means for agencies and departments in general and for your role in particular

###Putting users first

User-centred processes start with [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs). In this session the group will:

*  meet some users of government digital services
*  explore different techniques for finding out what users need
*  write some user stories
*  decide what requirements count as user needs

###Thinking agile

[Agile](/service-manual/agile) marks a fundamental shift from traditional methods of delivery in government. This session will introduce agile thinking and show how it leads to better outcomes. You'll cover:

* agile as a mindset, much wider than a set of tools and techniques
* the principles to be found in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and how they apply to software projects and beyond
* the agile disciplines that keep teams focused on outcomes and maximise the chances of success

###Meeting the service standard

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is the benchmark your services must reach in order to be taken live on GOV.UK. You will:

*  learn about the standard, how it was created and what tools are available to help departments meet it
*  consider how services will be assessed against the standard
*  assess which parts of the standard are most challenging for your own services and department
*  identify development needs to help you and your department to meet the standard

#Pre-learning requirements
As preparation before the day, we ask that participants:

* complete a [pre-course questionnaire](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/F9XYFMB) to tell us why you're coming on the Digital Foundation Day, and how much you already know about digital in government
* spend 45 minutes to 1 hour looking over the Government Service Design Manual on GOV.UK. Important pages to read include [user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html), [agile](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/index.html) and the [Digital by Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default).
