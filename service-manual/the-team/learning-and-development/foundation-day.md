#Who should take part

The foundation day is a one-day workshop for people delivering services in government.

Participants may be in specialist digital roles, such as product manager, business analyst, designer or developer, or in other roles that are expected to work closely with digital teams.

It is not recommended for newly appointed service managers, who should book to attend the [service manager induction programme](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/service-manager-induction) instead.

GDS will run the foundation day at a central London location, but also plans to support departments and agencies in making it more widely available.

#What's covered

The foundation day includes the following modules:

###Why are we here?

Together we’re leading the digital transformation of government, by making services so good people prefer to use them. This introductory session explores:

*  why we need to change the way government does digital
*  what has happened so far, including the launch of GOV.UK and adoption of the 25 exemplar transformations
*  what this means for agencies and departments in general and for your role in particular

###Putting users first

User-centred processes start with [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs). In this session the group will:

*  meet some users of government digital services
*  explore different techniques for finding out what users need
*  write some user stories
*  decide what requirements count as user needs

###Thinking agile

[Agile](/service-manual/agile) marks a fundamental shift from traditional methods of delivery in government. This session will introduce agile thinking and show how it leads to better outcomes. You'll cover:

* agile as a mindset, much wider than a set of tools and techniques
* the principles to be found in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and how they apply to software projects and beyond
* the agile disciplines that keep teams focused on outcomes and maximise the chances of success

###Meeting the service standard

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is the benchmark your services must reach in order to be taken live on GOV.UK. You will:

*  learn about the standard, how it was created and what tools are available to help departments meet it
*  consider how services will be assessed against the standard
*  assess which parts of the standard are most challenging for your own services and department
*  identify development needs to help you and your department to meet the standard
