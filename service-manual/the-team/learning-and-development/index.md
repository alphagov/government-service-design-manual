GDS offers 3 highly practical learning and development programmes so you can strengthen the skills, knowledge and network you will need to succeed in your digital role.

#[Service manager induction programme](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/service-manager-induction)

Six days to equip [service managers](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager) with the basic knowledge, network and confidence to take the lead in transforming digital services.

This programme is designed specifically for newly appointed service managers who complete the programme in cohorts drawn from across government departments and agencies.

#[Specialist digital foundation day](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/foundation-day)

The foundation day is a one-day workshop covering the main points of digital in government for people directly involved in delivering services.

Participants may be in specialist digital roles, such as product manager, business analyst, designer or developer, or in other roles that are expected to work closely with digital teams.

It is not recommended for newly appointed service managers, who should book to attend the service manager induction programme instead.

#[Open programme](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/open-programme)

Two days of more specialised modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).  These days are now encompassed within the Service Manager Induction Programme but are also open to participants who have completed the foundation day or those who are already very familiar with digital in government.

Newly appointed service managers will attend both days of the open programme as part of the induction programme. Others may choose to join any or all of the days as appropriate to their role and development needs.
