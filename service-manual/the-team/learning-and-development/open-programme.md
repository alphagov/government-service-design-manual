#Who should take part

These 3 days contain specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).

Unless already very familiar with digital in government, participants should complete either the [specialist digital foundation day](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/foundation-day) or the [service manager induction](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/service-manager-induction) before taking part in the open programme.

All sessions will run at a central London location.

The programme is funded centrally, but you or your department will need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies.

#Supporting people to use your digital service

This one day module will cover [digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup), digital inclusion and [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital), and focuses on supporting your users to use your digital service. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard.

It’s essential to ‘shift’ people away from non-digital channels and increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can benefit from improved government services. Departments and agencies will also come under increasing pressure to deliver the return on the investment in digital services -- estimated at between £1.7 and £1.8 billion per year.

Digital inclusion helps people become capable of using and benefiting from the internet. This means that most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help through assisted digital support.

You will:

* learn about why it’s important to support people to use your service

* develop your understanding of why people might not use your digital service and how to overcome barriers

* walk personas through a user journey, to see where they might need support and what that could look like

* discuss the requirements of the Digital by Default Service Standard for these areas, covering expectations at each development phase

* share your experience with other service managers and work together to improve your understanding of effective support for digital services.

#Design and improve your digital service

This one day module will cover the GOV.UK Design Principles, user research and data-driven services. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard.

##Design principles in action

A set of simple but powerful [design principles](/design-principles) underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will:

* discover the 10 design principles and how they were created

* hear from a product manager who has used them on a project

* consider how they will be applied to your own services

##Always be testing

Carry out user research in every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage -- don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. You will find out how doing user research continuously will:

* keep your team concentrating on real user needs

* help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs 

* help teams iterate products in response to user feedback

##Data-driven services

Using data to inform decision-making is vital to the development of your services. Your group will:

* discuss your service's performance indicators as they currently stand

* consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use

* design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way

* find out about the [Performance Platform](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform) and how you can use it

#Practice, procurement and platforms for your digital service

This one day module will cover governance, procurement and spend control in an agile context, along with an overview of the GOV.UK Verify platform. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard.

##Procurement, spend control and governance

Delivering high quality digital services that improve continuously often depends on effective procurement. As a group you will:

* consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development

* discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions

* hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations

##Being agile

GDS delivery managers will lead discussions and exercises around key features of agile, such as:

* agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories

* sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible

* retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together

##Identity assured

We need to know that users of digital services are who they say they are. In this session, you will learn how the GOV.UK Verify Programme is:

* creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers

* setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments

* building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers

* working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ GOV.UK Verify requirements and plan their transition to using the GOV.UK Verify service

#Request a place

The GDS Skills Team will invite all service manager induction and foundation day participants to book their places on the open programme. If you have not completed either of these, but are very familiar with digital in government and wish to book straight onto the open programme, please contact the Skills Team for an invitation: [service-manager-programme@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:service-manager-programme@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)
