#Who should take part

The 6-day induction programme aims to equip [service managers](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager) with the basic knowledge, network and confidence to take the lead in transforming digital services.

This programme is designed specifically for newly appointed service managers who complete the programme in cohorts drawn from across government departments and agencies. As part of the induction programme, participants will complete the [open programme](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/open-programme) days.

All sessions will run at a central London location.

Your place on the programme will need to be paid for by your department, so please ensure you have the required budgetary approval to attend.  If you have any queries please email digital.academy@dwp.gsi.gov.uk. Your department will also need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies.

#What's covered

The induction programme includes the following modules:

###Why are we here?

Together we’re leading the digital transformation of government, by making services so good people prefer to use them. This introductory session explores:

*  why we need to change the way government does digital
*  what has happened so far, including the launch of GOV.UK and adoption of the 25 exemplar transformations
*  what this means for agencies and departments in general and for the role of service manager in particular

###Putting users first

User-centred processes start with [user needs](/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs), and so does this induction programme. In this session the group will:

*  meet some users of government digital services
*  explore different techniques for finding out what users need
*  write some user stories
*  decide what requirements count as user needs

###Digital leadership

Which principles of leadership can be brought to bear in the new era of agile digital services? Your group will:

*  find out how high achieving digital leaders get things done so you can model and demonstrate that behaviour in your department
*  hear war stories from someone who is a leader in the digital field
* take away tips and practical advice on digital leadership

###Thinking agile

[Agile](/service-manual/agile) marks a fundamental shift from traditional methods of delivery in government. This session will introduce agile thinking and show how it leads to better outcomes. You'll cover:

* agile as a mindset, much wider than a set of tools and techniques
* the principles to be found in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and how they apply to software projects and beyond
* the agile disciplines that keep teams focused on outcomes and maximise the chances of success

###Meeting the service standard

The [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) is the benchmark your services must reach in order to be taken live on GOV.UK. You will:

*  learn about the standard, how it was created and what tools are available to help departments meet it
*  consider how services will be assessed against the standard
*  assess which parts of the standard are most challenging for your own services and department
*  identify development needs to help you and your department to meet the standard

###Building the team

As a service manager you need the support of a [multidisciplinary team](/service-manual/the-team) working intensively together through rapid iterations. Your group will:

*  understand the roles needed in an agile, user-centred service re-design team
*  get to the heart of what job titles and descriptions really mean, so that your department can appoint the right people, and at the right levels
*  consider the team’s tools and working environments
*  identify specific development needs for yourself and your team members

###Technology for digital services

You may not be the most technical person on your team, but as service manager you cannot leave all the technology decisions to others. This session will cover:

* choosing technology, making it possible to change your mind and avoiding lock-in
* risk and risk management, and getting the whole team thinking about security
* questions to ask your development team to help them make the best technology decisions possible

###Make, test and learn

It's time to try out the methods and tools picked up on the programme so far. In this practical exercise your group will:

*  self-organise to respond to a real-life brief
*  discover user needs, write user stories and prototype solutions to meet them
*  test your solutions with target users and iterate based on what you learn
