You may need specialist help to design, develop, build or improve your service. When buying in these services, there's support GDS may be able to provide.

##Identifying the skills you need
When you have an idea of the service you are going to create, talk to your team about the skills that are lacking. This is your chance to develop skills in-house, so before you go outside the civil service, first see if you have team members who can be developed into roles.

If not, you can hire individuals or companies to fill in the gaps of specialist skills.

##Individuals

GDS can help you hire some roles. We have job descriptions for:

* [delivery managers](/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager.html)
* [designers](/service-manual/the-team/designer.html)
* [developers](/service-manual/the-team/developer.html)
* [web ops](/service-manual/the-team/web-operations.html)
* [content designer](/service-manual/the-team/content-designer.html)

Other descriptions will be made available. Please [contact the team](/service-manual/feedback) if you have particular descriptions in mind.

GDS can give you some advice on certain candidates or interviews and setting contracts.

##Companies
If you need part of a team or a complete team, remember: you are buying skills to help your team or to build your team around. You are not locking yourselves into a long contract, with minimum spend criteria etc.

##Choosing your supplier
When you are considering an individual or company to work with, they should give you evidence of:

* a proven track record of [Agile](/service-manual/agile/index.html) delivery
* how they will use [continuous delivery](/service-manual/agile/continuous-delivery.html) methods
* how they will share knowledge and provide coaching and mentoring to civil servants who are developing and/or will be responsible for the service
* how they will deliver in an Agile way; possibly while working with departments who work in waterfall or PRINCE delivery method
* their commitment to work on-site with civil servants to share knowledge
* how they will ‘bake in’ [quality](/service-manual/agile/quality.html) to the process

They should also be aware of the [departmental digital strategies](/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research) and how they will need to work with them.

GDS can give you advice on buying this sort of capability through existing processes like G-Cloud, Spot-buy etc. You can now use the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.gov.uk/digital-marketplace).

##People, not process
An underlying principle behind Agile development is that people are more important than process. It has been proven that great teams make great products whether they’re in government or business.

At GDS, we don’t call people ‘resources’, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard).

##Guidance for a smooth induction

Some guiding principles for service managers or delivery managers:

* make sure you have enough budget
* speak to your HR team and confirm you can negotiate salary etc, particularly for technical roles
* shield your people from the form-filling culture that HR sometimes brings
* contractors shouldn’t work from home all the time (be sensible here, the odd day won’t hurt)
* monitoring the work through project tracking tools, but most importantly talk to your people and understand the work they’re doing

And don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things.


##Working together
Suppliers and permanent staff should sit together, work together and work through problems together. The team should create an environment where difficult questions can be asked and all ideas are listened to. All team members should work to do the right thing for the user, not just what they have been asked to do.

Both suppliers and permanent staff should suggest ideas and work together to identify further skills gaps and solutions to create a better product.

The individual's or company's intention should always be to disengage from the department, leaving the team to function on its own.


##Knowledge transfer
Your team structure and processes should centre around transferring knowledge to permanent staff, wherever possible.

Don’t let a contractor become a single point of failure and treat all team members (permanent and contractors) the same.
