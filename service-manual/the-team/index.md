The right team needs to be in place to deliver a digital by default service. Teams are multidisciplinary, meet regularly, and often work close together to deliver rapid iterations of user-centred products. 

They combine designers, developers, researchers and content specialists to deliver a project, and may expand or contract in size as services are developed. The exact shape of the team will vary across departments, and depend on various factors including the number and scale of any transactional services the department is redesigning and running, and the extent to which each will be delivered in house.

## Service managers

Regardless of the delivery approach, all transactional services need to have a [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html).

The service manager is likely to need support from a core team focused on analysing user data, identifying user needs, writing user stories, reporting and other aspects of stakeholder management and governance.  

## Building a digital delivery team

There are a range of skills and capabilities that need to come together to successfully deliver a digital service. The focus is likely to shift as you move through the different phases of development - from discovery, through alphas and betas, preparing for launch, and then running and iteratively improving the live service. The core team is likely to remain fairly constant, but may need to draw in additional resource and expertise along the way. 

At the heart of any digital delivery team will be the 'makers' - the designers, developers, technical architects and others who design, build, test and deploy the software and content that meet the needs of your users. 

Supporting and enabling this 'making' are others who make sure the user needs are well understood, clearly articulated and prioritised, that stakeholders are kept informed, that releases are well communicated, that users of the service are supported, that performance is monitored etc. 

### The team

A core digital delivery team needs to be able to: 

* analyse [user needs](/service-manual/users/user-needs.html), and turn these into [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) 
* manage the scope and prioritisation of stories 
* manage and report to stakeholders
* managing dependencies on other teams 
* where needed, [procure services or solutions from 3rd parties](/service-manual/the-team/working-with-specialists.html)
* design, build, test, demo and iterate software solutions (the 'making'!)
* [test solutions](/service-manual/users/introduction-to-user-research.html) on real users 
* [deploy and host](/service-manual/operations/hosting.html) the software 
* find solutions for [accrediting and handling of data](/service-manual/making-software/information-security.html)
* [supporting the live running of the service](/service-manual/operations/index.html) (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)

There is no hard and fast rule on the roles or team structure needed to fulfil these functions, but a core team will probably consist of:

* a [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html) (the 'product owner')
	* probably supported by a product manager 
	* possibly supported by one or more performance analysts ([job description for this role](/service-manual/the-team/performance-analyst-jd.html)) 
* a [delivery manager](/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager.html)
* a tech lead
* one or more [designers](/service-manual/the-team/designer.html)
* one or more [developers](/service-manual/the-team/developer.html)
* one or more [content designers](/service-manual/the-team/content-designer.html)
* the support of a technical architect
* the support of some [web ops expertise](/service-manual/the-team/web-operations.html)
* the support of some user research expertise ([job description for this role](/service-manual/the-team/user-researcher-jd.html)) 

The team will also have a shared understanding of the [accessibility needs](/service-manual/the-team/accessibility.html) and possible [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) needs of a service's users.

### Working with delivery teams outside of government

If some elements are going to be delivered by 3rd parties (eg software, hosting or operational support) then it will be important to have 'intelligent buyers' in the team. These people will know how to go about [selecting and procuring specialists](/service-manual/the-team/working-with-specialists.html), and what to do to make sure their introduction to the team is as smooth as possible.

Whiteboard, wall space and proximity can make a big impact on the effectiveness of a team. [What can a service manager do to ensure they get the best out of their agile team?](/service-manual/the-team/working-environment.html)
