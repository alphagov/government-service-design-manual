Content designers make sure that the content on the site meets the needs of the user as clearly, simply and quickly as possible.

##The importance of content designers
You can add up, but it doesn’t mean you’re an accountant. You can write, but it doesn’t mean you’re a content designer.

For many reasons, in the past the government has often published content that’s difficult to understand and difficult to act on. 

What gets published can be more about what the government wants to say than what the user needs to know.

At best this results in a frustrated UK. At worst, citizens and businesses get into trouble because they can’t understand (or can’t face wading through) difficult content.

The content designer’s job is to make sure that doesn’t happen.

##Skills and attributes
Content designers must be able to:

- [identify user needs](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/22/needs-to-content/) - based on legacy content, source material provided by policy colleagues, feedback from users and stakeholders and analytics data both from the site and from search engines
- gain an in-depth knowledge of a wide range of subjects - so they can make informed decisions about the best way to present information to users
- develop content plans and strategies - high-level plans showing how the identified user needs will be met
- [write great content](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/11/its-all-about-the-words/) - in plain English, optimised for the web and according to [house style](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide#style-guide)
- edit content - making sure the site remains accurate, relevant, current and optimised both for users and search engines
- make tough decisions and work hard for the user - grappling with complicated legislation and turning it into clear, clean, crisp web content (that still has enough depth to be useful)
- work with developers and designers to [create better solutions](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/05/tools-over-content/) - for example, writing logic and content for smart answers
- understand and incorporate the results of [user testing](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/08/24/learning-from-user-testing/)
- review the work of other editors - to ensure consistency and excellence across the site
- publish content - using various systems
- communicate the principles of good content design to others in the organisation
- advocate for the user and act as a ‘gatekeeper’ for the site - pushing back on change requests that don’t contribute to meeting user needs and incorporating change requests that do
- build positive relationships with others inside the team and in the wider organisation
- innovate and anticipate - excellent content designers are excited about the possibilities of web content and involved in the ongoing conversation in the digital sector
