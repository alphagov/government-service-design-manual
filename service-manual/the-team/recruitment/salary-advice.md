Delivering the business change required to create excellent digital public services and supporting technology systems in departments will be a large and exciting challenge for those who lead it. For that transformation to be successful, we have to make sure that we have ‘best in class’ candidates for technology leadership and specialist positions in post. These roles will demand a combination of highly sought after strategic, delivery and leadership skills, as well as specialist technical knowledge. Appropriately rewarding such staff is essential to their recruitment and retention.

Government is not looking for average candidates. We need people with a track record of delivery and an appetite for driving important change in a highly visible job. As such, GDS recommends that departments offer candidates between 75th and 90th percentile of the typical London-weighted salary band for a similar role in the private sector. GDS has conducted independent benchmarking research that samples hundreds of similar roles in order to produce these range figures, and will review the market rate on an ongoing basis to ensure that the offer government makes to technology is highly competitive. For further advice on salary offers, please contact the [Recruitment Hub](mailto:digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). Template [job descriptions](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions.html) for many of these roles are available to download from the manual.
