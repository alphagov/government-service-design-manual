To deliver excellent digital public services, and support to departments’ technology systems, we have to change the way we do business. 

Creating this change will be a large and exciting challenge. For it to be successful, we need to make sure that the ‘best in class’ fill technology leadership and specialist positions. 

These roles require specialist technical knowledge, and a combination of highly sought-after skills in: 

* strategy
* delivery
* leadership

Template [job descriptions](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions.html) for many of these roles are available for you to download. 

## Recommended salary percentiles 

Government isn’t looking for average candidates — we need people with a track record of delivery and an appetite for pushing important change forward, in a highly visible job. 

Appropriately rewarding such staff is essential to their recruitment and retention. As such, GDS recommends that departments offer candidates between the 75th and 90th percentile of the typical London-weighted salary band for a similar role in the private sector. 

## Role-specific salary ranges 

GDS produced these ranges by running independent benchmarking research that sampled hundreds of similar roles. We’ll review the market rates on an ongoing basis to make sure that government’s offer to the technology sector remains highly competitive.
