Building great digital services and supporting technology requires strong leadership and a wide array of technical skills. These are often not yet common across government. It also means rebalancing the skills and priorities of existing senior technology roles.

## Recruitment Hub

GDS is supporting departments in bringing in these new skills by setting up a Recruitment Hub.

[Find out more about what it does and how it will support departments in recruiting digital and technology skills](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/hub.html).


## Organisation design

Having the right roles is just as important as having the right people. That applies as much to leadership teams guiding digital transformation across the department as it is does for the teams delivering digital services on the ground.

## Job descriptions

To get the right skills into government, we need make sure we’re asking the right people to apply.
