GDS is supporting departments on digital and technology recruitment through a Recruitment Hub. This service is designed to help ensure the best possible candidates are in post to deliver excellent digital public services supported by the right technology. The hub will provide recruitment guidance, support and advice to departments for senior and specialist roles.

The Recruitment Hub is not intended to replace existing HR and recruitment processes, and exists purely to help organisations acquire these new and hard-to-reach skills.

## Senior Civil Servant (SCS) recruitment

GDS must approve the job descriptions and appointments for all SCS-level technology positions. All senior grades (Deputy Director / Grade 5 level and above) are part of the Senior Civil Service, which is overseen by the Cabinet Office on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Senior civil servants may be called to account by Parliament, and are barred from holding any political office. 

The template [job descriptions](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions), and [organisation design advice](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/scs-orgdesign) should be a useful starting point for departments and agencies to tailor to their specific roles.

For SCS level hires, the Recruitment Hub could also provide:

* feedback, advice and approval on tailored organisational design and SCS job descriptions as needed, to ensure that the lines of reporting and share of responsibilities between other digital and technology (IT) leaders within organisations are clearly set out.
* guidance in coordinating headhunting support for departments looking to identify suitable candidates for senior appointments
* GDS expertise to work with departments in sifting, shortlisting and interviewing of applicants

Campaigns need to be planned effectively with sift and interview dates agreed before advertising so that GDS can provide appropriate resources with enough notice. 

Departments should continue to liaise with advertisers and Civil Service Commissioners directly.

## Non-SCS specialist recruitment

GDS does not need to approve the appointment of non-SCS specialist posts, but will again provide guidance, support and advice for departments seeking to bring in specialist digital skills. The template [job descriptions](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions) and [organisation design advice](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/scs-orgdesign) should again be a useful starting point for departments and agencies, and is likely to require less tailoring than SCS roles.

In addition, the Recruitment Hub could also provide:

* feedback and advice on the design and organisation of digital delivery teams within departments
* guidance on routes to market (frameworks etc)
* guidance and advice on attraction and recruitment campaign strategies 
* GDS expertise to work with departments in sifting, shortlisting and interviewing of some key Band A / Grade 6 / Grade 7 specialist posts

In specific cases where a position requires a particular specialist set of technical skills (eg technical architects, designers), departments should request sifting or shortlisting support from GDS via the Recruitment Hub. This service should be requested before the post is advertised. 

We cannot promise to provide this in all cases, but will try to make expert advice available from the shortlisting stage for crucial posts.

**All queries for the hub should be made to [digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).**
