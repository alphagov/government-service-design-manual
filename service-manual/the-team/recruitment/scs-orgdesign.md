Government has traditionally treated IT as a single entity with the same approach being used for very different types of service. Government IT is more appropriately mapped into distinct areas with different user needs --- some are public facing, and some are for internal use. These areas include:

* digital public services
* mission IT systems
* infrastructure
* back office services

These [4 areas](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/05/21/rebalancing-tech-across-gov/) are in very different stages of development. Digital public services, for example, are being built by developers using very new technologies. In contrast, technology infrastructure such as data storage has evolved over the course of decades.

Products which 5 or 10 years ago would have required detailed and expensive customisation are now commoditised (packaged as ‘pay-as-you-go’) -- to the extent where they have virtually become utility services like gas or electricity (you can move between suppliers easily).

By using technology based on commodity products and services government can benefit from economies of scale and much greater efficiency.

##Leadership

Improvements to digital and technology leadership will create a new way of working in government, supporting teams across the civil service in producing digital public services and better department-specific IT (or mission IT), and ensuring these teams have the right technology to support them.

For this to happen, government digital and technology leadership should be strongly represented at board level and be specifically responsible for enabling business change. In many cases digital services and department-specific IT should -- for now -- be managed as separate but strongly linked workstreams, with a common aim of ensuring transformation across the department.

In all cases where departments run digital services, digital should be represented at the same or higher seniority level as technology.

The new roles of the [Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO)](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/job-descriptions) are for strategic, transformative leadership.

CDOs will concentrate on producing digital public services and the wider [digital by default strategy.](/service-manual/digital-by-default)

CTOs will concentrate on providing the department-specific IT that supports digital public services and internal users. CTOs will also be in charge of moving their departments to common technology services.

Both CDOs and CTOs will need to work out which areas can be commoditised and which need customised services. Both roles need to be getting the most out of new technologies, and will need to structure their teams accordingly.


##People
Models, structures and strategies are irrelevant without the right people in the right roles. The best way to restructure senior technology roles will vary across departments according to how much involvement they have across the [4 areas of government technology.](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/05/21/rebalancing-tech-across-gov/)

In some cases both the CDO and CTO will sit on the board; in other cases they might report into a board level Chief Operating Officer (COO), or only the CDO might be on the board. 
Where digital public services rely on department-specific IT systems to support them, a [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager) role should be in place, reporting into the CDO with accountability and decision-making authority for the end-to-end service.

In all organisations, roles that manage existing contracts, retiring legacy systems, and providing infrastructure services should be subordinate to leadership roles.

GDS will provide support by establishing common infrastructure services so senior leaders in departments can concentrate on providing department specific technology for their users.

GDS has also established a [Recruitment Hub](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/hub) -- an advisory service provided to departments to help them recruit talented technology leaders and digital specialists.

As part of the Recruitment Hub service, GDS has already begun to work with departments and agencies to help with organisation design. Contact [digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for more information.

##Future organisation design: maintaining agility and relevance
The CTO/CDO organisational model is not designed to provide a fixed structure for decades to come. It’s a model that reflects the current state of government technology with both large legacy estates and new digital services in development, and is designed to support the changes in technology use over the next 3 to 5 years.

Over time the distinction between digital public services and department-specific IT will weaken. As legacy systems are retired and more [technology is delivered through the cloud](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/transforming-government-services-to-make-them-more-efficient-and-effective-for-users/supporting-pages/buying-cloud-based-it-products-and-services), it will make less sense to draw a separation between the two areas. It’s quite possible that in 5 years’ time both citizens and internal users will use the same digital services and technology.

Organisation and governance structures -- both within and across departments -- will need to develop too. It will be part of the responsibility of senior digital and technology leaders to keep the effectiveness of these structures under review to ensure that they remain fit for purpose.
