Many of the skills now needed in government - both from the leaders of digital and technology teams and the teams themselves - are ones that have rarely been looked for in the past. To help support recruitment teams across government in bringing in those skills GDS has written a set of template job descriptions for SCS and specialist posts.

These job descriptions assume that organisational design guidance set out in the manual has broadly been followed. For advice on tailoring these designs to your organisation, contact GDS via the [Recruitment Hub](/recruitment-hub.html).

The templates have left gaps for departments to complete. Recruiters will need to add:

* information about the department and its objectives
* information about the role and current priorities / activities in digital and technology
* location
* recruitment process details and contacts
* information on reporting lines
* GIS declaration and Immigration Status Forms

Before advertising any SCS technology position, the GDS Recruitment Hub must have reviewed and agreed the job description after it has been tailored to a specific organisation and post. GDS does not need to approve non-SCS job descriptions prior to advertisement, though will provide advice if asked by departments.
