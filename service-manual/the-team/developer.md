Developers build software with a relentless focus on how it will be used. They continually improve the service by identifying new tools and techniques and removing technical bottlenecks

Good digital services will require code to be written, adapted, maintained and supported. A team of skilled developers will be able to make sure that happens in an efficient and transparent way, and to help continually improve the service by identifying new tools and techniques and removing technical bottlenecks.

## The importance of developers

No digital service can be effectively built, delivered, owned and operated without the technical skills to understand and improve the software enabling it. In order to provide the best service to your users it is vital that you are in a position to rapidly tailor that software to their needs and to the efficient running of the underlying systems.

Developers will be able to work directly on those services, but are also an important part of service innovation as they bring ideas, generate prototypes and contribute to a rounded team. 

Once a service is live the need for developers continues. There will always be technical optimisations that can be made -- faster and more responsive systems, acting to mitigate the risks of a constantly changing security environment -- but as you respond to new or more clearly understood user needs the software will need to adapt. As the policy and other context around a service changes the software may need to integrate with new systems or provide new features and a development team can help ensure that work is pro-active.

## Skills and attributes

A great developer:

* builds software with a relentless focus on how it will be used
* seeks collaboration and early feedback
* designs software they expect to operate and maintain
* leaves code simpler and better tested than when they started
* looks for opportunities to share progress and knowledge
* is always hoping to learn from colleagues and the wider community
* distinguishes the important from the urgent
* uses data to make decisions, building tools to gather that data

You would expect any developer to:

* have deep skills in at least one programming language
* be aware of the differences between a few languages and frameworks, and be pragmatic at picking the right one
* understand the core concepts of the internet and web -- they should be able to give a good answer to the question 'what happens when I click a link in a web browser?'
* be deeply committed to testing their work with automated tests and exploratory testing
* be able to explain their work to people without particular technical skills

## Developers in the team

It's really important that your team is clear as to who makes technical decisions. Everyone on the team will have useful knowledge, skills and experience to bring to bear and you will need an agreed way to understand that input and make a call. Some teams accomplish that by appointing a Tech Lead or delegating certain decisions to a Technical Architect, others will put that responsibility in other roles. The important thing is that clear technical decisions be made by people equipped to understand the trade-offs involved.

As your team grows it is likely that you will find a range of skills and experience. You should be ensuring a balance within the team, making sure that more junior team members are well supported and coached by more experienced team members, but that everyone's ideas are considered and engaged with by the team and its decision maker.
