Digital leaders act as the single point of contact for the department’s strategic interactions with GDS, including co-ordinating digital activity for departmental agencies, arm's length bodies and non-departmental public bodies.

They are senior civil servants (generally executive or director general level) drawn from every department of government and the devolved administrations, and they have experience of leading large scale transformation programs inside and/or outside government.

## Digital by default

Digital leaders promote and encourage take up of ‘Digital by Default’ within their department, with stakeholders and customers. This means actively participating in the delivery of the Government Digital Strategy and Departmental Digital Strategy actions, ensuring these are fully embedded in the Department’s Business Plan.

## GOV.UK

Digital leaders also act as the strategic governance mechanism for the GOV.UK domain, informing policy and strategic direction of digital.
