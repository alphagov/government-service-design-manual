#Button labels
<p>A button is the one place on the page that allows your user to move closer to their goal. Here, you will find out common conventions and style guidance. </p>

<p>If the user doesn’t need to do something &ndash; it should be  a link. Buttons are for actions only.</p>

##Guidance
<p>Don&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>use technical terms &ndash;  use ‘delete’, not ‘form reset’
<li>make button text too long &ndash; but do make it specific</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Use:</p>
<ul>
<li>verbs and an active voice</li>
<li>sentence case</li>
</ul>


###Button labels
<p> Use these terms for common actions:</P>
<ul>
<li>start now &ndash; at the beginning of the service</li>
<li>next &ndash; not forward, go etc</li>
<li>save &ndash; only tell the user about the action that will lead to a result &ndash; so if the action is to save a page and then move on to the next one, only tell the user &lsquo;next&rsquo;.</li>
<li>finish &ndash; at the end of a service and you are taking them to a confirmation page</li> 
<li>back &ndash; not previous etc</li>
<li>sign in / sign out &ndash; not log in / log out</li>
<li>create an account &ndash; not register</li>
<li>sign up &ndash; only for mailing lists</li>
</ul>


###Multiple buttons
<p>If you have a number of actions on the page &ndash; make sure you are very clear. Don’t have similar actions too close.</p>

<p>For example: Clear and Finish</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clear&rsquo;, as a secondary action, should be a link; &lsquo;Finish&rsquo;, as the primary action, should be a button. </p>


##Code/Templates
If you're giving people code r copy to cuta and paste then here is where it will go.

##Why we do this
<p>Users want the maximum amount of information in the shortest time. In a service, users are already more action-orientated than when expecting to read flat copy. They will want to click a button &ndash; it means they will be one step closer to finishing their task.</p>

<p>Eye tracking shows users are less likely to read long labels. We don’t want them to get the action wrong &ndash; that will lead to frustration so we need to be clear, informative and succinct.</p>

<p>Users look at the left of a box and then look for the label &ndash; or down the labels. Making labels short uses fewer eye muscles. This in turn, makes it easier for the user.</p>
