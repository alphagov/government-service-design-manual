#Accessibility skills
Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility. Provide training and resources to 
help your team build accessibility into everything they do. That includes 
planning, designing, building and managing.

Include at least one person with strong accessibility knowledge in your team. 
Make them Accessibility Lead, and give them overall responsibility for educating and supporting your team’s accessibility goals.

##Guidance
The key skills required by an accessibility-focussed developer are:
* Strong analytical skills;
* A methodical approach to testing;
* Empathy for users with different, often contradictory needs;
* An in-depth knowledge of modern accessible development best-practices;
* The ability to communicate at all levels.

##Why we do this
Accessible, usable products are the heart of everything we do at the GDS. Your service needs to be just as thoughtful to the needs of all possible users so that no one is excluded on the basis of disability.
