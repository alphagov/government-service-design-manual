Digital by default services will include assisted digital support for users who are not able to use digital services independently. 

These users will be helped to use the digital service, or someone will use it alongside them on their behalf. This help might be provided in person, on the phone, or through another appropriate channel. 

You can read more about assisted digital in the [Government Approach to Assisted Digital](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/).

## Who needs Assisted digital support?
Assisted digital support is for users who are not able to use digital services independently. 18% of UK adults are offline and the GDS Digital Landscape Research provides a [demographic breakdown](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#fig-5) of who is online and who is offline. 

Each service will have a different proportion of users who are not online and [understanding user needs](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/users/understandinguserneeds.html) is vital for putting in place appropriate assisted digital support. Some services (e.g. where users are large corporations) will not require assisted digital. 

## What good looks like
Good assisted digital support: 
* is based on user needs
* is as similar to the digital service as possible
* is consistent for users  
* where appropriate, incorporates an element of learning so that people are encouraged to use the digital service independently in future
* is provided externally
* with the digital service, replaces existing non-digital channels such as phone or face to face as the demand for them decreases

The assisted digital user may deal with the service face-to-face, on the telephone, or in another way, but their information will be fed into the digital service by the person or technology they are interacting with. Sometimes, assisted digital users will interact with the service digitally in a way that is accessible and appropriate, for example, by using the service with an intermediary who helps them use a digital interface, whether in person or remotely.

To ensure consistency, assisted digital support must follow shared models of assisted digital and be procured collaboratively. The shared models and procurement routes are being developed by GDS and departments (for more information, see the Government Approach to Assisted Digital).

There will be a strong presumption towards procuring external resource to provide assisted digital support, from the private sector, the voluntary sector, and other parts of the public sector. In exceptional circumstances, departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example, where a business case for external provision does not demonstrate good value for money. Transitioning from in-house to external provision will be phased in as the marketplace of assisted digital providers is established.

Where an alternative channel remains, it will be recalibrated to provide assisted digital support. 
Uses and builds on existing methods for delivering assistance to people accessing services in their local area.

## How are we developing our approach to assisted digital?
Departments and GDS are working together to develop assisted digital support for the [exemplar digital by default services](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-05). The experiences with these services will inform shared models and shared procurement routes for assisted digital. If you are not an exemplar service but would like to get involved in this work, please contact GDS.
