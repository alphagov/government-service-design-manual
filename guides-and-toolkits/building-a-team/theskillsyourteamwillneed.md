#Accessibility skills
Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility. Provide training and resources to 
help your team build accessibility into everything they do. That includes 
planning, designing, building and managing.

Include at least one person with strong accessibility knowledge in your team. 
Make them Accessibility Lead, and give them overall responsibility for educating and supporting your team’s accessibility goals.

##Guidance
The key skills required by an accessibility-focussed developer are:
* Strong analytical skills;
* A methodical approach to testing;
* Empathy for users with different, often contradictory needs;
* An in-depth knowledge of modern accessible development best-practices;
* The ability to communicate at all levels.

##Why we do this
Accessible, usable products are the heart of everything we do at the GDS. Your service needs to be just as thoughtful to the needs of all possible users so that no one is excluded on the basis of disability.





#Digital analytics team skills

This guidance describes some of the skills required to do the job and provides template job descriptions to help you start building a strong team.

##Guidance¶

* Strong numerical skills

* Understands how digital analytics works

* Can distill large amounts of complex data into clear, actionable insights
* Comfortable working with service managers and senior managers

##Why we do this¶
The reason we hire skilled analysts is that high quality digital services continually develop and improve over time. Development doesn’t stop once the service is operational. Once a service is live, analytics provide a key tool in understanding what behaviours users are exhibiting. Working with user insight colleagues who focus on the why of behaviour, they provide the business with vital data to help product managers make decisions about new releases and features. It continues apace with new releases happening daily or even hourly. Analysts provide the conduit between the huge amounts of data generated by high volume services and the insight required by service managers to make product improvements. It is this key skill of distilling data into actionable insight that makes a good analyst.

#Design skills
A good digital service needs needs talented, flexible designers and to help build user centred products.

##Guidance
Designers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working and avoids silos. They should either already do this style of working or at least understand it.

When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to talk you through their contribution.

##Why we do this
Finding talented people is hard. But to build world class digital services we need to build a world class design team.

Let's be clear about the impact of your work, making better digital services has a positive impact on millions of people.Avoid the terms “ux” and “creative”. Especially avoid “creative directors”. They will attract the wrong sort of people.
