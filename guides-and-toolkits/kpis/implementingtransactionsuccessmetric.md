#Implementing completion rate
This guidance covers implementing the completion rate KPI, including what to do when and how frequently to measure. Please refer to [Defining KPIs](/guides-and-toolkits/kpis/definingkpis.html) for a definition of completion rate.

##Guidance/Tool
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Inception</th><th>Alpha</th><th>Beta</th><th>Live</th></tr>
<tr><td>Must</td><td>Ensure the transaction start and end pages have unique URLs</td><td>Benchmark task completion rate via a survey or usability testing and establish reasons for failure</td><td></td><td>Measure task completion using digital analytics software. Continually improve and optimize the service using task</td></tr>
<tr><td>Should</td><td>Develop a plan to measure completion rate throughout product development. Assess the available analytics tools</td><td>Procure digital analytics tool</td><td>Conduct more than one round of usability testing to ensure that task completion rates improve</td><td>Carry out further usability testing to continually identify any usability problems and feed into service design</td></tr>
<tr><td>May</td><td>Set task completion time as an a KPI if you have identified that users want to complete tasks as quickly as possible. This may not be the case for some services e.g. Lasting Power of Attorney</td><td>Benchmark task completion time</td><td>Measure task completion time via usability testing</td><td>Use A/B or multivariate testing to test alternative designs, implementing those which improve completion rates</td></tr>

##How frequently should I measure task completion rate?
The user survey (alpha) and usability testing (beta) should be carried out at least once but it is recommended that these methods are used to support the ongoing development of the service even after launch. Digital analytics measurement is a continual process and should carry on indefinitely after launch.

##What level of completion should I aim for?
You should aim for a 100% rate of completion.

The minimum you should plan to achieve by launch is 80%. This will be measured via usability testing of at least ten people in either a lab-based or remote setting. This should identify [over 90%](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html) of usability problems. Users will be given a pre-determined set of tasks that reflect what needs to be done to use the service. These tasks will include all aspects of using the service that apply, such as registering, applying, submitting, verifying, amending and unsubscribing. An average of 80% must be achieved across all tasks for the service to go live. Further rounds of testing may be necessary if users are having difficulty completing tasks.

##What about post launch?
Digital analytics will be the primary method for measuring task completion rates post launch. Please note that this relies on extra configuration in the analytics tool. It will not be available by default.

The focus of the service team’s activities will be to continually improve this by monitoring where users are dropping out of the transaction process and testing out new designs for those pages. Completion rates will need to be piped automatically from the product’s digital analytics into the [Performance Platform](http://www.gov.uk/performance) and will be publicly available from the point of launch.
