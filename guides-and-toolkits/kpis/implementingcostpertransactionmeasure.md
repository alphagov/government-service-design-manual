#Implementing cost per transaction
This guidance covers implementing the cost per transaction KPI, including what to do, when to do it and how frequently to measure. Please refer to [Defining KPIs](/handbook/134/) for a definition of cost per transaction.

##How frequently should I measure cost per transaction?
Cost per transaction is measured on a quarterly basis and reported via the Quarterly Data Summary (QDS) [link]. It should cover the last twelve months to eliminate seasonal fluctuations. 

Cost per transaction should be measured for the existing service - if there is one - to create a baseline against which future cost per transaction can be compared. This should be done continually on a quarterly basis and reported via the QDS. When the digital service is exposed to real users (whether in alpha or beta) it should be included in the reported cost per transaction.

##What cost per transaction should I aim for?

Cost per transaction should follow a downward trajectory over time. The aspiration is that digital by default services achieve a cost of 80 pence per transaction within five years of launch. In practice this figure may have to be adjusted to take into account large fixed costs which are unlikely to change over time, regardless of digital take-up.

##Worked example - DVLA

This worked example sets out the DVLA methodology used to calculate unit costs, and shows how this has generated a historic and future profile for vehicle licensing transactions and unit costs. The timeline runs from the inception of the electronic licensing channel as this provides a useful example of a multi-channel service.
DVLA Costing Methodology

The first consideration should be the purpose and use of the cost. An internal recharging model will be more concerned with the direct costs of the service, whereas an external cost recovery model will need to consider overhead apportionment and other forms of contribution.
 
Once the purpose of the model has been established, appropriate expense heads need to be identified. Consideration needs to be given to the cost type, i.e. whether they are fixed, semi-fixed or variable in nature. Fixed cost elements (as the latter worked example will show) will have the result of reducing unit costs as volumes increase. Purely variable costs are reliant on volume so there is a linear relationship between a pure variable unit cost and the volume of the transaction.
 
In many cases, the unit cost is made up of a combination of fixed and variable elements. In the example below the fixed cost elements include expense heads relating to the development of the digital channel; support and maintenance; and salaries (although they are more appropriately classified as semi-fixed). The variable costs that feed into the model include consumables costs, postage and those relating to the intermediary service – i.e. the contracted price per transaction.
 
In establishing the unit costs of the licensing service via the various channels all relevant costs (as outlined above) are collated to give overall totals and these overall totals are then divided by the actual, or where applicable, the forecast transaction volumes.
 
Detailed assumptions are maintained that underpin each of the expense heads, their relevance to the transaction and any adjustments that have been made. Version control is key in order to provide an audit trail.
DVLA Licensing transactions since the inception of electronic channels (EVL)

There are currently three channels through which the user interacts with the DVLA to license a vehicle – the intermediary Post Office; the Local Services Network; and via the Electronic Vehicle Licensing channel (EVL). Graph 1 shows the transaction volumes across the three service channels.

Prior to 2004 all licensing activity was processed through the Post Office (DVLA intermediary) with a low and static number of complex transactions via DVLA Local Services Network. The overall volume of licensing transactions is itself fairly stable with perhaps a 2% increase in total volume every 5 years. Following the introduction of the electronic channel there has been a steady increase to date in usage which is forecast to continue beyond 2013/14. The corresponding effect of this is a decrease in Post Office transactions.

Graph 2 shows the impact on the unit cost of the channel shift. As we can see the Post Office, or largely variable cost, gradually increases over the period. This cost is contractual, therefore as volumes decrease unit costs increase. The electronic unit cost is largely fixed in nature. As volumes increase, overall unit costs decrease to a static level which represents the variable cost. Even with volumes predicted to almost double, the unit cost should remain fairly constant.
