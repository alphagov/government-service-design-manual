#Understanding the size of the Assisted Digital audience
Service managers need to understand how many of their users are likely to be able to use digital services independently 
and how many are unlikely to be able to use digital services independently. These people will need assisted digital. 

##Guidance/Tool
User research and management information can be used to to understand assisted digital needs. 
Customer Insight practitioners or User Experience researchers use techniques such as customer segmentation 
(link here?) and profiling to divide their customer base into groups of individuals that are similar 
in specific relevant ways. This helps them to analyse factors in the use of a service eg. age, gender, 
disability, interests, motivations, needs or other demographics. These techniques allow them to target 
specific customer groups effectively, identify their related challenges, allocate resources, identify 
marketing strategies and meet their specific needs. 

Customer journey mapping (link here?) is another 
tool that enables organisations to map the touch points or life events which trigger 
engagement with government or public services and how this interaction could be managed more effectively 
for the user.

##Why we do this
User needs for assisted digital will also vary depending on who the users are. For example, services 
with large numbers of older people may need different assisted digital provision from services with 
large numbers of younger people. 

##Further reading
In November 2012 we commissioned independent research on the [digital landscape](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/)
to explore internet use in general and to gain insight on the relationship between users and government online transactions.
