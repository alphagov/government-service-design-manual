#Error messages
<p>There are 2 types of error messages in services: </p>
<ul>
<li>the ones at the top of the page highlighting that there's a problem </li>
<li>words around the label that was incorrectly completed</li>
</ul>

##Guidance
<p>Error messages at the top of the page</p>
<p>Use simple, clear instruction: "The unique tax reference number you entered was not recognised. Please try again."</p>


<p>Error messages at the label</p>
<p>Tell the user how to fix the problem in the clearest way, for example: "The number should be 10 digits long and include 3 letters."</p>


##Why we do this
When an error happens, most users blame themselves and their frustration with the service increases. We need to make sure the user is confident enough to correct any problems quickly and easily. We also need to make sure all services are intuitive and hide complexity. So, for example, if a date of birth has to be in a certain format for the system to work, make sure you disply a calendar or similar. Then, the user is less likely to make a mistake and error messages will be unecessary.
