#Optimizing covnversion rate
Conversion rate is considered a good [web KPI](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/rules-choosing-web-analytics-key-performance-indicators/) because it focuses on outcomes and is traceable to a website’s goal. However, looking at conversion rates in isolation fails to generate user insight or suggest actions for improvement. This guidance suggests approaches that product teams may use to optimize a service post launch.

##Methods for improving conversion rate
The eConsultancy Conversion Report 2010 lists the following methods for improving conversion rates:
* A/B testing
* User journey analysis
* Multivariate testing
* Cart abandonment analysis
* User testing
* Online surveys/user feedback
* Event-triggered/behavioural email
* Segmentation
* Copy optimisation
* Expert usability reviews/consultancy
* Pinch-point analysis

An interesting report by McKinsey entitled [E-government 2.0](https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/E-government_20_2408) finds that governments have failed to deliver on investments in online services and argues that more should be invested in web analytics expertise. It cites the example that Google has 50 to 200 online experiments running at any one time and argues that governments should adopt a similar approach. It stresses the importance of *data-driven decision making* and specifically mentions the following methods:
* set clear goals and measure success
* track quantitative data through dashboards
* collect user feedback
* test and learn through usability testing and piloting
* test and learn through A/B and multivariate testing

##Segmentation
The eConsultancy Conversion Report 2010 found that businesses whose online conversion rates improved looked at twice as many segments compared to businesses whose online conversion rates did not. It recommends:
                  	                                                        	
> Analyse conversion for different segments, specifically, new versus repeat visitors, channel used to access site, product and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).

It gives the following examples of segments:
* Purchased any product: Compare the activity of those that have purchased (happy with the brand) to those that have not. This is most powerful when trying to understand what non-customers are doing on the site. Put any inactive users into a reactivation programme.
* Repeat Visitors: Understand the difference between the user behaviour of returning prospects and first time visitors.
* Channel used to access site: How the user entered your site is a big clue to how they need to be treated. If they entered with the search term “cheap holiday” send them emails on cheap deals. If they entered via a PPC ad promoting a “luxury break” send them an email about luxury breaks.
* First time buyers: Paying customers act differently to first time browsers. By splitting the data in this way you can focus on your buying customers. It is these users that are important to you. Use the information extracted via online behaviour to understand how these users like to shop.
* Product segments: It is important to have segments per product so you can analyse the activity of users based on what they like to buy. Trends in behaviour may differ depending on what product is being purchased.
* Advocates: Separate regular visitors from infrequent visitors. It is the regular visitors you want to pay attention to. Understanding these users is critical because how they behave is how you want all users to behave.
* Engagement: Recent visitors are more engaged and can be contacted more frequently.
 
Avinash Kaushik also sees value in pushing beyond a simple conversion rate, although it’s still one of his [Six Web Metrics/KPIs to die for](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/rules-choosing-web-analytics-key-performance-indicators/). He also looks at the number of sessions taken to complete a transaction (segmented into ranges), number of days since last visit (segmented into ranges) and number of visits per visitor (segmented into ranges).

##Retention rate
The [McKinsey e-performance report](https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/E-performance_The_path_to_rational_exuberance_975) also sees value in considering new versus repeat users and stresses the importance of customer retention. It looks at conversion within the broader process of attraction, conversion and retention. That is, getting users into a service, getting them through it and getting them to re-use it.

> Perhaps our most important finding is the power of retention. A 10 percent increase in the rate at which visitors are converted into repeat customers drives a 10 percent improvement in the net present value of a company’s expected cash flows

An analysis of costs and revenues per visitor, per customer and per repeat customer shows that repeat customers are cheaper to acquire and worth more. McKinsey says more effort is needed to ensure customer loyalty. In practical terms this may mean keeping information so a user never has to provide the same information twice, or emailing users to remind them to use a service again.
