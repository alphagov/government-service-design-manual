#Heuristic evaluations/expert reviews

This section of guidance looks at Heuristic evaluations and expert reviews, and how they can be used to provide

##Guidance

Heuristic evaluations and/or expert reviews are discount (low cost) usability methods that don’t involve the participation of real end users.  An ‘expert’ usability evaluator can assess a product (or web site) against a known set of ‘heuristics’, or usability guidelines (best practice).  An alternative approach is to conduct a ‘cognitive walkthrough’ against specific use cases or scenarios.  

For heuristic evaluations, ideally two usability experts will conduct the review independently, and then meet to discuss and agree the findings before making recommendations to the service manager.  A list of widely accepted (although not necessarily validated) heuristics are provided by Jacob Nielsen (www.useit.com) or an alternative set can be found in the International Standard ISO 9241.

A ‘cognitive walkthrough’ is a usability inspection that aims to identify usability issues by focusing on how easy it is for users to accomplish specific tasks with the system (or website).  This method starts with identifying the user goals, then conducting a task analysis to specify the sequence of steps or actions required to achieve each task.  The usability expert, along with designers and developers, then walk through these identified steps to assess the extent to which a user can achieve their goal.

##Where/how you might use it

Both of these approaches can be used to evaluate an existing product or website, or as a quick, low cost method of evaluating a product in development.  These approaches can be considered to be “better than nothing”, but will never provide the same quality insight as testing with real end users.  However, a competent usability specialist will often identify issues that are subsequently seen in traditional user testing or in actual use.

Some agencies conduct expert reviews as the first step of all usability projects.

##Weaknesses/when not to use

The fundamental weakness of any expert review is that it doesn’t involve use by real end users.  Some people or stakeholders may therefore consider this to be purely opinion, but input from an experienced usability expert is better than no user testing at all.

##No./Types of participants
None are involved.  Ideally two usability experts are involved in the review.

##Cost
Dependent on whether there is any in-house expertise available to conduct the review.  An agency can be commissioned, with costs upwards of &pound;2K depending on the service scope.

##Timescales
Depends on the scope of the service - for a simple website application this could be turned around in 1-2 days.
