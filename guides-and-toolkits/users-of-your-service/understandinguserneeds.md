#Understanding user needs
If you understand your user needs, you will create a digital service that works for your users. Use data to find out what your user needs are, and work out the optimal way of answering those needs with your service.

##Guidance/Tool
Any thinking about a service, whether online or offline, must start with the question: What is the user need?

Defining a user need must be strict and honest. For GDS, it’s the need the *user* has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user.

###Design with data
Data can help tell you what your user needs are. Take search:

What core search terms drive traffic to your service? Examine external search engine data to understand the queries that are driving people to your site for answers.

Look at site-search. If people are searching within your site, they are expecting to find that information on it. Pay attention to the specific queries and the variations on core terms - they can tell you reams about the elements of a topic that people are trying to find out. 

***

**Example:** looking at site-search analysis of Directgov, we found a very popular variation on sick pay, many site-searches for ssp1. This form is given by the employer to those non-eligible for Statutory Sick Pay to help them claim the benefit Employment and Support Allowance. 

***

Scrutinising core search terms and variations within site-search helps you define the specifics of your user needs. This will inform how you provide the solution, the hierarchy of information within that solution, and the language you use (it should be the language of users).

Other metrics can help you understand your user needs. Analyse the level of engagement people have with different parts of your service. As well as volume of traffic, measure the interaction.

***

**Example:** We analysed Directgov pages using number of visits + interaction with a page. We measured interaction using length of stay and number of links clicked. We could identify both ‘failing’ content (low traffic, poor interaction) and ‘successful’ content (high traffic, high interaction and importantly, low traffic but high interaction).

***

Using a combination of search and metrics analysis, we could identify the bones of the user need from a page containing surplus content.

###Work out your proposition
You need to set the boundaries of what your service can and should offer, to prevent a bottomless list of user needs. This is especially true of a government website such as GOV.UK. As well as identifying user needs, we identified which of those needs the government must answer. This led to the ‘It’s in if...’ criteria:

- it’s something that only the government does
- there is clear demand for it from users (ie. through search and traffic logs) or the government is legally obliged to provide it
- it’s something that people can do or it’s something people need to know before they can do something that’s regulated by/related to the government
- it’s something the government provides, does or pays for
- it’s inherent to a person’s or an organisation’s rights and obligations
- it’s straightforward advice that helps people to comply with their statutory obligations (eg. what records you should keep for your HMRC tax return) or provides certain kinds of advice and support to businesses, but excludes general life or business advice that is provided by third parties

##Code/Templates
Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

1. Define the user need
2. Write the user story from the perspective of the user
3. Define the acceptance criteria
4. Solution is explored and delivered by the service team

*As a [type of user], I want to [insert the task/desire] so that I [insert the benefit]*

The ‘so that’ is optional.

##Why we do this
> 1. Start with needs (user needs not government needs)

The first of the [GDS Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples "GDS Design Principles") is about user needs. It underpins everything. By concentrating on meeting true user needs, you will create a digital service that works effectively for the people who are using it. It’s that simple!
