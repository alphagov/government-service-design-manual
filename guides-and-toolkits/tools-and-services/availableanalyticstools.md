##Available analytics tools

There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service. You will need to assess how well a particular tool meets your needs before deciding which one to use. This guidance describes some of the criteria you should consider and reviews some of the main analytics tools against those criteria.

###High level requirements

When you are deciding which analytics tool to use you should consider the following criteria.

* Cost: you should consider the total cost of ownership as well as cost in comparison to turnover of service
* Scalability (will data be sampled at high volumes?)
* Data ownership (do you solely own the data?
* 1st party cookies only
* Profiles and custom variables (do you pay more for additional profiles/custom variables?)
* Admin system (does it provide a strong admin system for user access?)
* Hosting (is it vendor hosted or in house?)
* Multi-channel (can it track offline channel usage?)
* Standard reports (does it provide a comprehensive set of standard reports including social interactions and multimedia capturing?)
* Open API (does it provide an open API with no export restrictions?)
* Funnel analysis (can it measure transactions through funnel analysis and measure goals?)
* Support and training

For each of these criteria, you should identify which are fulfilled as part of the standard quoted package and what is charged for in addition.

##Vendor comparison

The following table assesses four major analytics tools against the criteria set out above. This information was compiled from Econsultancy’s Web Analytics Buyer’s Guide 2012 and input from colleagues in GDS, HMRC (Business Link) and DH (NHS Choices). Of course, there are other vendors in the market place, including open source solutions such as Piwik.

<tr><th></th><th>Google Analytics Premium</th><th>Adobe Omniture</th><th>WebTrends</th><th>Digital Analytics (Comscore)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cost</td><td>&pound;90k per year</td><td>Based on onsite actions and page views</td><td>Charged per server call at low level at higher levels at volumetrics. Will charge mixed fee for the contract. If exceed will review charging model.

SDK mobile is  extra for Apps; but mobile site use is no extra.</td><td>Based on number of monthly server calls, type of measurements, integration of external marketing tools, size and type of user base including concurrent users. Prices quoted &pound;200k year 1 and &pound;400k year 2 just for licensing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Data ownership</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unsure</td><td>Unsure</td><td>Unsure</td></tr>

<tr><td>Vendor hosted solution</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multi-channel</td><td>Multi channel funnels and attribution analysis available</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes but not necessarily part of standard package</td><td>Yes but may incur extra costs</td></tr>

<tr><td>Funnel analysis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Support and training</td><td>Yes and implementation at no extra charge</td><td>Yes but at extra cost</td><td>Yes but at extra cost</td><td>Yes but at extra cost</td></tr>
<tr><td>Expert review</td><td>If you are running a lot of PPC, media campaigns, marketing then Google Analytics Premium is a good option as this is a fixed cost regardless of the volume of visits you have to the site.</td><td>Adobe Omniture is the biggest one out there. However, there are downsides, this is expensive and any additional functionality you require comes at a cost from different modules.</td><td>Webtrends is great to keep an accurate (or as close as it can be) record of traffic to the site. and this records it on a session by session basis. and whilst not out of the box you can create any number of scenario and funnel reports for transactional activities.</td><td>Comscore is a great all-rounder and is an easy install across multiple pages. This measures every activity and for a very busy site can get very expensive as they charge per call.</td></tr>
