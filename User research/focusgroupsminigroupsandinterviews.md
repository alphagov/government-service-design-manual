#Focus groups, mini groups, and 1:1 interviews
Your section will begin with a short, two-line summary of what you're showing people.

##Guidance/Tool

##Description
 
Focus groups, mini groups, and 1:1 interviews involve unstructured interviews or group discussion. A focus group is normally comprised of 6-12 people, although sometimes mini groups are favoured (4-5 people) as they can lead to a greater depth of discussion. 1:1 interviews are conducted by a moderator with a single respondent, sometimes these are conducted over the phone (telephone depths).
 
Interviews and discussion groups are both facilitated by a trained moderator using a specially designed topic guide (see section 8 for writing topic guides) in order to ensure the discussion is focused and keeps on topic. Sessions normally last 1-2 hours and will often involve participants being shown stimulus – e.g. communications materials to inform discussion, and sessions may include interactive techniques e.g. role play scenarios.
 
##Where/how you might use it
 
Focus groups and 1:1 interviews are useful techniques for exploring and mapping reasons for attitudes and behaviour, how target audiences approach issues or may be encouraged to change. They also enable participants reactions to be monitored, and the moderator to probe on interesting issues when necessary. As stated in the previous section, the presence of a moderator also enables discussions to be focused and kept on track.
 
Dedicated viewing facilities are often used that enable sessions to be recorded, and interested parties can observe the sessions (often via a two way mirror) in a separate room to the participants. This often results in the research having more credibility as interested parties will have been able to see the sessions, and witness the findings first hand - this also means key issues can be acted upon quicker as observers can feed straight back to their teams. Some sessions take place in community settings, encouraging less confident/harder-to-reach audiences to attend.
 
The number of groups is often directed by the budget available, but the average project will have 4 to 6 groups, and larger ones could have 10 to 20. Besides budget, other factors that will influence the number of groups used are the number of potential users groups that need to be covered, and the number of geographic areas.
 
Focus groups and 1:1 interviews are techniques often used in the following types of research:

* **Formative/contextual research** - enables you to understand how and why people behave/do things in a certain way. Help understand user needs before products are built. Qualitative and Quantitative methods can be used (qual to understand reasons/feeling etc, quant to understand scales/volumetrics). See section on Formative/Contextual research
* **Concept/Alpha Testing/Development** - Qualitative and Quantitative research to measure users reactions to new product ideas. See section on Concept development.

##Weaknesses/when not to use 

Focus groups and 1:1 interviews can be expensive compared with other types of research. The small samples size means that findings are not statistically significant and it is difficult to generalise them across audience groups. Due to the nature of the data gathering, and that all responses are all as verbatims, analysis can also be time consuming.

It is also important that the focus moderator builds a rapport with respondents. If he/she fails to do this, and can’t control the group adequately,  it can result in the sessions being dominated by one or two participants, and the biased data collected.

##Participants

Participants can be obtained from the general population and hard to reach groups. Focus groups normally consist of 6-12 people. Mini groups are smaller with 4-5 people. Obviously 1:1 depths interviews just have one participant.

##Timescales
   
Normally 6-8 weeks from briefing to results. Analysis period needs to be sufficient to be thorough.

##Cost

* 1:1 depth interviews - approximately £ CHECK
* Focus groups - approximately £3k
