Caveat: I'm not a security expert and this needs input from that perspective before publishing.

CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"

CAPTCHAs exist to prevent bots (automated software) from completing a form or accessing a system.

CAPTCHAs put the burden of detecting bots on the user, contributing to a bad user experience. They should be avoided where possible. Instead of asking the user to prove they're not a bot, the burden should be on us to automatically detect the telltale signs of a bot.

There are alternative, completely invisible methods of detecting automated form completion, and combinations of those methods may provide an adequate barrier as an alternative to a visual CAPTCHA.

Different transactions pose different risks if a bot got in. Choose security measures relative to the risk. Use unobtrusive alternatives to visual CAPTCHAs where possible. Government is a target – be responsive to the need to change security measures as attackers learn our systems.

Smashing Magazine (not known for its security expertise, admittedly) has an article about the Honeypot Method and Recording User Time Expenditure as two ways of automated bot detection. http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/04/in-search-of-the-perfect-captcha/

Accessibility Where a visual CAPTCHA is an absolute necessity, remember to include an alternative audible CAPTCHA for the visually impaired.
