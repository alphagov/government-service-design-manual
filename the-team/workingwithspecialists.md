Specialists can help fill the gaps in capability you identify throughout your service’s lifespan. However, the benefit of their skills and perspective can come with the challenge of procuring and inducting them.

## How do you identify the skills you require?

As the service manager or product owner’s vision is shaped by the team, you may encounter areas where you lack the necessary expertise to deliver to a high standard. First, talk to your team and see if they can identify the skills lacking. If you find these can’t be found within your wider department then it might be time to think about procuring specialists. You can talk to GDS and other service owners at any time for their advice on what to do next.

Trust domain experts to define what you need to be looking for. Developers and designers will be best placed to tell you what front end skills you need, for example. GDS can help provide guidance and job specifications if you need to further define the role.

If you know particular individuals are the best fit for a particular skill then there’s nothing wrong with hiring them. GDS are happy to provide advice on a prospective candidate too. Equally there’s nothing wrong with using a recruitment specialist to get the candidate you need. Remember that the service will be judged on what it delivers, so you must have confidence that the specialists you recruit are the right people to deliver that work.

GDS can also provide support to departments to assist them during their procurements for Digital / Agile services, whether this is using existing purchasing frameworks / tools (e.g. G-Cloud, Spot-Buy, etc) in advance of the Digital Procurement Framework being available, or following its go-live. This support could include early-stage supplier engagement in the form of hack days, proof of concepts, prototypes, etc, either in advance of, or as a first-stage evaluation for, a formal procurement.


## Proposed Digital Procurement Framework

The Digital Procurement Framework is being designed by the Government Digital Service and Government Procurement Service and following an OJEU is expected to be available to departments from the middle of 2013. This will enable departments access to a wide range of suppliers of all sizes. These will supply people and teams rather than hardware, software and the like, to build digital services. What follows is a brief description of a framework which will come on stream in Summer 2013.

### How will it work?

GDS will ensure there’s a sufficient supply of companies able to deliver digital capability where government does business. The list of suppliers available on the framework will be refreshed periodically (e.g. every 4 to 5 months) as technology and the market moves.

We want to provide an online portal that enables departments to buy Digital / Agile services from the suppliers on the Digital Procurement Framework, and are currently looking at utilising the platform that GDS is building for the G-Cloud team, ideally leading to a single point of entry for buyers and suppliers alike.

This portal would support the 'source to settle' process, including:

* input their requirement
* receive responses
* evaluate
* award
* order
* pay
* buy supplier 'bench' capability at a reduced rate

### Differences between G-CLOUD and the Digital Procurement Framework

In addition to those features described in the following table, The Digital Procurement Framework will also have a more suitable supplier payment structure and Terms & Conditions.

### Where does G-CLOUD fit in?

While the GDS Digital Framework focuses on Agile development, some services to be available on the new framework are currently available in [G-Cloud](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/). However G-CLOUD’s primary focus is commodity services, such as infrastructure and hosting.  


## Managing consultants and specialists

Achieving the right mix of contract versus permanent staff on your team will depend on your product.

Contractors should receive an induction and be thoughtfully integrated in team - where do they sit, who next to, how do they fit? Use some common sense; think about how long will this person be with you and tailor the induction accordingly. 

For example, in the [GOV.UK](www.gov.uk) platform team, GDS hired a specialist search engine consultant to work with the team for two days. He worked with two permanent members of the team so they could learn from him. 
 
Skills transfer is vitally important - we can all learn from specialists. But more importantly, don’t allow a contractor or consultant to become a single point of failure in your team. Knowledge must be shared for the maximum benefit.

For the good of your team and to get the best results from bringing in a specialist contractor, you should not treat them any differently from a permanent member of the team, they are people too. 

### People over Process

An underlying principle behind agile development is that people are more important than process. Throughout the digital world, it is proven that great teams make great products whether they're in government or business.

At GDS, we do not call people “resources”, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard!).

### Guidance for a smooth induction

Some guiding principles for service managers or delivery managers:

* make sure you have enough budget 
* speak to your HR team and confirm you have the flexibility to negotiate salary etc, particularly for technical roles
* shield your people from the form-filling culture that HR sometimes brings
* contractors shouldn’t work from home all the time (be sensible here, the odd day won’t hurt)
* monitoring the work through project tracking tools, but most importantly talk to your people and understand the work they’re doing

And don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things!
